/**
 * workflow.e2e.test.ts — the Workflow tool driven end to end, for real.
 *
 * Every other workflow suite stubs something. The runtime tests inject a fake
 * `WorkflowHost`; the tool tests drive a stub `AgentManager`. Both are the right
 * call for what they assert, but neither proves the parts fit together: a script
 * has to be parsed, compiled in a vm inside a worker thread, call back over the
 * RPC bridge, reach the real `AgentManager`, spawn real agent sessions against a
 * faux model, and carry results back across the JSON boundary.
 *
 * The evidence used here is what the *child* model calls actually saw. If a
 * subagent's context contains the prompt the script wrote, then every link in
 * that chain ran — nothing else could have put it there.
 *
 * No network and no keys: the faux backend answers every model call. Each run
 * pins `live: false` rather than trusting the env var to leave it alone — the
 * pre-publish smoke sets PI_E2E_LIVE globally, and every assertion here rests on
 * a scripted `SubagentWorkflow` call a real model has no reason to emit.
