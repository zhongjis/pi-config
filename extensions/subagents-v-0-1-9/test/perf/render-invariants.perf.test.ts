/**
 * render-invariants.perf.test.ts — the shape of the render paths, asserted as
 * operation counts rather than as time.
 *
 * These run in the normal suite, which means they run three times per CI push
 * (build, floor-Pi, latest-Pi) on shared runners. A wall-clock threshold there
 * would be a flake generator: two runs of identical code in this repo differed
 * by 7% on ordering alone. So nothing here is timed. Counting how many times a
 * render reaches a leaf is deterministic, costs milliseconds, and catches the
 * regression that actually hurts — work that stops being linear, or a frame
 * that starts touching the disk.
 *
 * Absolute numbers live in `test/perf/*.bench.ts`, where a human reads them.
 *
 * Every bound here is an upper bound, never an equality: making one of these
 * paths cheaper must not turn a test red.
