## Use in responses

- Use Agent Skills links for format, metadata, progressive disclosure, descriptions, and skill evals.
- Use OpenAI links for API implementation patterns, function calling, hosted tools, guardrails, sandboxes, prompt caching, response-style APIs, and harness engineering practices.
- Use Anthropic links for simple agent patterns, context engineering, tool ergonomics, long-running harnesses, agent evals, MCP execution patterns, and skill architecture.
- Use MCP links for wire-level server and tool discovery, typed catalogues, authorization, catalogue caching and change signals, and connector design. The protocol does not by itself verify semantic suitability, establish trust, or grant execution authority.
- Use environment-adaptive and programmatic tool research for claims about code-as-action, large or unseen API catalogues, retrieval against changing documentation, and novel API use; do not treat those sources as proof of the stronger host-owned discovery, binding, or authority contracts in this skill.
- Use recursive and continual harness research for taxonomy, architecture comparisons, and claims about the underlying patterns.
- Use OWASP and NIST links for threat modeling, governance, auditability, and enterprise deployment controls.
- Use implementation examples, including Prime Agent, as concrete shape references, not as normative architecture, dependencies, or provider-neutral policy.
