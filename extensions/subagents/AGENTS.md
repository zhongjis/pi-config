# Development Rules

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")
- Technical prose only, be direct
- When the user asks a question, answer it first before making edits or running implementation commands.
- When responding to user feedback or an analysis, explicitly say whether you agree or disagree before saying what you changed.

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not fully inspected, and when asked to investigate or audit. Do not rely on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Inline single-line helpers that have only one call site.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types (`@earendil-works/pi-*`, `@sinclair/typebox`, etc.); don't guess.
- **No inline imports** (`await import()`, `import("pkg").Type`, dynamic type imports). Top-level imports only.
- Never remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated deps; upgrade the dep instead.
- Match the surrounding code style — it is enforced by biome (`biome.json`).
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- This is a pi extension. Respect the Claude Code-compatible tool names, calling conventions, and UI patterns the extension deliberately mirrors; don't diverge from them without a stated reason.
- When reviewing a diff, favor solutions that are elegant, not overengineered — flag needless abstraction, layering, or defensive code that the change doesn't warrant.

## Documentation

Read the file that covers a surface before changing its behavior; update it in the same change.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | User-facing reference: features, install, tool parameter tables, commands, settings and defaults, the event table, the RPC channel list, and the `src/` file map (`## Architecture`). Source of truth for defaults and setting names. |
| `docs/workflows.md` | `SubagentWorkflow` in depth — how the model writes a script, editing and re-running it, saving a named workflow, `agent()` options, recipes, troubleshooting. Examples in `examples/workflows/`. |
| `docs/rpc.md` | Calling this extension from another pi extension — `pi.events` lifecycle events (`subagents:completed`, `subagents:ready`, …), the `subagents:rpc:*` channels (`ping`, `spawn`, `stop`, `consume`), spawn options, error strings, and the `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` registry. Source: `src/cross-extension-rpc.ts`. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor guidelines and quality bar. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability reporting. |

`README.md` holds the reference tables and links out; `docs/` holds the long-form guides. Each guide states its audience in its first three lines — read that before deciding it is the wrong file. Renaming an event, an RPC channel, a reply-envelope field, or a workflow global is a docs change too.

## Commands

- After code changes (not docs), run the full check suite and fix all errors and warnings:
  ```bash
  npm run check       # lint + typecheck + test (what CI runs)
  ```
  The steps individually, when you need to isolate a failure:
  ```bash
  npm run lint        # biome
  npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
  npm run test        # vitest run
  ```
- `npm run lint:fix` auto-fixes most style issues.
- `npm run test` runs the whole suite, including `*-e2e.test.ts` files. To iterate on a single file, run it directly: `npx vitest run test/<file>.test.ts`.
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate on the test or implementation until it passes.
- `npm run build` compiles with `tsc`; run it only when verifying the build output or when requested.
- `npm run bench` runs the benchmarks in `test/perf/*.bench.ts` (absolute timings, ~1 min). Opt-in: it is not part of the check suite, and `npm run test` never picks bench files up. `npm run bench:ab -- <ref>` benchmarks the working tree against another commit and prints the delta — use it for a PR's `## Performance` section. The `*.perf.test.ts` guards beside them assert operation counts, not time, and DO run in the normal suite.
- For ad-hoc scripts, write them to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp`), run, edit if needed, remove when done. Don't embed multi-line scripts in `bash` commands.

## Git

- **Never commit.** The user commits manually. At most, suggest a concise commit message as text.
- **Never push**, tag, or create branches unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never run history- or worktree-destroying commands: `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`, or any force push.
- Leave the working tree as the user left it — don't stage, stash, or revert files you didn't change.

## Issues and PRs

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor guidelines and quality bar.

### Filing PRs

Write the body to a temp file and pass `--body-file` (`gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`); never multi-line markdown via `--body`. Create or edit a PR only when the user asks.

- One logical change per PR. Title in conventional-commit form (`fix(ui): ...`), imperative, no trailing period.
- Self-review the diff before filing; drop unrelated refactors and leftover debug code.
- Write for a reviewer who will not read the whole diff: what changed, then what it costs.
- Technical prose, no emojis, no marketing.
- Every claim checkable — from the diff, or from a command you actually ran. Never quote a benchmark, test count, or "no change in output" you did not measure.
- State what the change does *not* do: deliberate omissions, known gaps, untested surfaces.

**Relations** — get the verbs right, and note `States as of opening.`

- `Closes #N` only if the PR fully resolves N. Otherwise name the part delivered and say N stays open.
- A merge does not auto-close another PR: say **supersedes**, credit the author (`thanks @user`), and say what of theirs was left out and why.
- Name PRs touching the same lines; say whether it is a design conflict or just a rebase.

**Sections**, in this order. Omit one only when it is genuinely empty, and say so:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Lead-in (no heading) | What this closes, supersedes, or partly addresses. |
| `## Summary` | The problem and why it matters — not how it is fixed. Enumerate distinct failure modes. |
| `## What changed` | The design: the one idea, then its consequences. Name files/symbols only where they help. |
| `## Related work` | Table: number, title, state, relation to this PR. |
| `## Behavior and compatibility` | Side effects, breaking changes (or an explicit "none", with reasoning), defaults, settings, migration. |
| `## Performance` | Numbers with the method that produced them. "No measurable change" only if measured. |
| `## Testing` | Commands and results, new coverage, and what is **not** covered. |

Add sections a change needs; use fenced `text` blocks or screenshots for UI changes.

Testing section: paste real results (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test` with pass/skip/file counts), not "tests pass". Mutation-check every new assertion — break the source line, confirm red, restore — and say what you broke.

### Reviewing PRs

- Do not run `gh pr checkout`, `git switch`, or otherwise move the worktree to the PR branch unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh api`, and local `git show`/`git diff` against fetched refs to inspect PR metadata, commits, and patches without changing branches.
- If you need PR file contents, fetch/read them into temporary files or use `git show <ref>:<path>` without switching branches.

### Posting issue and PR comments

- Write the comment to a temp file and post with `gh issue/pr comment --body-file` (never multi-line markdown via `--body`).
- Keep comments concise, technical, and in the user's tone.

## Changelog

Location: `CHANGELOG.md` (single file, [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format).

- All new entries go under `## [Unreleased]`, in the right subsection (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`, `### Security`, `### Refactored`). Read the section first and append to existing subsections; never duplicate them.
- One bullet per issue/PR. Never combine separate issues or pull requests into a single entry, even when they touch the same or similar components. (A PR together with the issue it closes or that diagnosed it is one change — one bullet citing both.)
- Breaking changes are not a separate subsection. Call them out with a `> **⚠️ Breaking: …**` blockquote at the top of the version section, and/or a bold `**BREAKING:**` bullet under `### Changed`, with a migration note.
- Entries are concise — a bold lead-in stating what changed, then a sentence or two on why it changed and anything a user must do about it. Aim for 2–4 sentences; a genuinely intricate change may run longer, but length is never the goal. Do not match the density of older entries, several of which are far too long.
- Cut what the reader doesn't need: narration of the investigation, alternatives considered and rejected, restatements of the diff, and detail recoverable from the code or the linked issue. Name a file or symbol only when it helps someone find the change.
- Released version sections (e.g. `## [0.12.0]`) are immutable; never modify them.
- Attribute external contributions: `... ([#456](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/456) — thanks [@username](https://github.com/username))`.

## Releasing

**Versioning** (all releases are `0.x`, no major bumps):

- `minor` (`0.x.0`) — a notable new feature, or any breaking change.
- `patch` (`0.x.y`) — bug fixes and smaller additions.

Before a release:

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` — move the `## [Unreleased]` entries under a new `## [X.Y.Z]` version section, and add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` for the next cycle.
- Update `README.md` if user-facing behavior changed (features list, settings, usage), and the matching guide in `docs/` if the change touches workflows or the event/RPC surface.
- Run the full check suite plus the e2e tests, and fix anything that fails:
  ```bash
  npm run check                    # lint + typecheck + test
  npm run test:e2e                 # faux/scripted e2e — no network, no keys
  npm run build
  ```
- For a real pre-publish smoke test, run the **live** e2e against an actual model:
  ```bash
  PI_E2E_LIVE=1 npm run test:e2e   # uses your local `pi` login; optional PI_PROVIDER / PI_MODEL
  ```
  `PI_E2E_LIVE=1` swaps the scripted faux suite for the live one (the faux suite is `skipIf(LIVE)`).
  (`prepublishOnly` runs lint + typecheck + test + build; the live e2e is the smoke test to run by hand before publishing.)

**Never publish.** The user runs `npm version` / `npm publish` and any tagging manually. Do not run those commands unless the user explicitly asks.

## User Override

If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in this document, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.

## Local Tweaks

| File | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `src/tool-rendering.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `test/tool-rendering.test.ts` | Width-safe call/result renderers for `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent`, with configured expand hints and raw expanded tool output | Preserve Panda Harness supervision formatting |
| `src/notification-rendering.ts`, `src/ui/summary-renderer.ts`, `src/constants.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `test/notification-rendering.test.ts`, `test/summary-renderer.test.ts` | Width-safe completion notifications use a shared lifecycle/stat/result summary and retain expanded preview/transcript details | Align completion presentation without changing notification content delivered to the model |
| `src/ui/agent-widget.ts`, `src/ui/summary-renderer.ts`, `test/agent-widget.test.ts` | AgentWidget uses the shared summary for running and finished rows, preserving live activity, context, and status detail | Keep widget and notification status vocabulary consistent |
| `src/index.ts`, `src/workflow/` | `SubagentWorkflow` runs without requiring worktree isolation; `schedule.ts` and `schedule-store.ts` removed | Workflows operate on repo-local runs; `croner` dependency dropped |
| `src/invocation-config.ts` | Thinking level resolved through shared lib helpers rather than inline | Consistent thinking-level propagation across tool surfaces |
| `src/index.ts`, `src/agent-policy-denial-result.ts` | Registered Agent affordance stays target-neutral; direct calls enforce the persisted mode delegation policy and policy-denial results are marked as errors | Preserve mode-owned routing across mode switches and post-upstream resyncs |

Worktree isolation, scheduling (`schedule.ts`, `schedule-store.ts`, `croner`), agent mentions, and model-scope features are removed or dropped from this fork. Agent target routing is intentionally mode-owned rather than copied from upstream's global target lists. Other upstream execution and model-facing content is preserved; FleetView and Thinking Steps remain unchanged.
