## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Subagent presentation now uses the Panda Harness supervision layout.** `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` calls and results render width-safe compact headers plus ordered lifecycle, activity, model, tool, context, turn, duration, and result rows with configured expand hints; expanded tool results preserve complete raw content. Completion notifications and AgentWidget now use the same shared lifecycle/stat/result summary, including live and terminal status details. Malformed presentation details fall back safely. Model-facing content, execution/model behavior, FleetView, and Thinking Steps remain unchanged.
- **Completed Agent sessions remain resumable for 30 minutes.** The terminal-record cleanup window is extended from 10 minutes so long parent verification passes can still resume foreground or background agents by ID. Running and queued agents remain exempt; session switch, reload, and shutdown cleanup are unchanged. The extra in-memory retention is bounded and does not make output transcripts resumable.

### Fixed
- **Foreground Agent results expose their exact resume ID and distinguish task incompleteness from output truncation** ([#174](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/174) — thanks [@killianMei](https://github.com/killianMei)). Foreground results already contain everything the child produced, so turn-limit, abort, and stop notes now describe whether the task may be unfinished instead of implying hidden output. The real Agent ID is included in model-visible content, allowing the parent to resume the retained in-memory session rather than infer an ID from renderer-only details. Regression tests pin foreground ID visibility, successful resume, terminal-record retention, and session-switch eviction.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Subagents can use extension tools that register asynchronously, e.g. over MCP** ([#141](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/141) — thanks [@philipmw](https://github.com/philipmw)). MCP-backed extensions usually can't enumerate their tools until their servers connect, so they call `registerTool` from `session_start` (pi-mcp) or `before_agent_start` (context-mode) rather than at load — eagerly connecting during extension discovery would orphan child processes on pi's non-agent code paths (`--help`, config, trust probing). The agent runner, however, snapshotted `extension.tools` into a static `tools:` allowlist immediately after `loader.reload()` and *before* `bindExtensions()` fired `session_start`. Because pi's `allowedToolNames` gates tool **registration** — not merely the initial active set — a name missing from that snapshot was dropped permanently, so those tools never reached a subagent even though the main agent had them. The runner now leaves the allowlist unset so pi's live gate admits tools whenever they register, and expresses the name-stable part of the scope (this extension's own orchestration tools, built-ins the agent didn't ask for, `disallowed_tools:`) as a denylist that pi re-applies on every registry refresh. `extensions: false` / `isolated: true` keep the static allowlist unchanged — nothing can register asynchronously there, and a hard registry gate is the right boundary.
- **`ext:` selectors keep narrowing correctly when tools register late** (fixes [#125](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/125)). Admitting late-registered tools is only half the problem: an `ext:` selector is an *allowlist*, and a not-yet-registered tool cannot be listed in one — which is why `tools: "*, ext:context-mode/ctx_execute"`, the exact configuration reported in #125, still saw nothing. `ext:` narrowing is now enforced on the **active** tool set (what the model actually sees) rather than the registry, re-derived from the loader's live extension maps — the same maps `registerTool` writes into — so a tool is judged against the selectors whenever it appears. Scope is re-applied on every `turn_end`, and the hooks live on the session rather than the spawning call, so steered and resumed turns stay scoped too. Turn 1 is guarded at call time instead: `before_agent_start` fires *inside* `prompt()` and can widen the tool set after that turn's tools are already snapshotted, leaving no window to narrow in, so an out-of-scope call there is refused rather than executed. Selecting a lazy extension (`ext:mcp`) now surfaces its tools; leaving one out still mutes it, no matter when it registers. Vetoing a call means wrapping the `beforeToolCall` hook pi installs on the session (pi exposes the veto to *extensions* as `pi.on("tool_call")`, but there is no equivalent for an SDK caller constructing a child session); the wrapper chains to pi's own hook so extension `tool_call` handlers still fire, and a `pi@latest` CI job guards that the hook stays reachable, so a future pi that moves it surfaces as a test failure rather than a silently missing veto.
- **FleetView selection markers now match the rest of the UI** ([#155](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/155) — thanks [@xz-dev](https://github.com/xz-dev), closes [#122](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/122)). FleetView was the only view using `⏺` (U+23FA) / `◯` (U+25EF) for its selected/unselected rows; everywhere else — the conversation viewer and agent widget — uses `●` / `○` (U+25CF/U+25CB), the base geometric circles with the broadest terminal-font coverage (`◯` renders visibly oversized in many fonts). Selection is already carried by the accent-vs-dim color, so the exotic glyphs added nothing. FleetView now uses `●` selected / `○` unselected, converging on the codebase's existing pair.
- **`get_subagent_result(wait: true)` is now cancellable** ([#159](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/159) — thanks [@exoulster](https://github.com/exoulster), fixes [#158](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/158)). The tool received the tool-call `AbortSignal` but ignored it, so pressing `Esc` during a wait couldn't cancel it — the call stayed blocked until the child finished, and pi could log a spurious `No running process to background.`. Cancelling now stops **only** the wait: the background agent keeps running, its result stays unconsumed, and its normal completion notification still arrives. Queued waits are abortable the same way. Because the wait no longer pre-marks the result consumed (a cancelled wait never consumes it), a successful wait still suppresses its own redundant notification by cancelling the held nudge on completion — the queued-wait poll interval was tightened so that cancellation reliably lands inside the notification hold window.
- **User-scope agent memory honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`** ([#166](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/166) — thanks [@biowaffeln](https://github.com/biowaffeln)). The `user` memory scope hardcoded `~/.pi/agent-memory/<name>`, ignoring `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` even though every other config consumer (custom agents, enabled models, settings, skills) already routes through `getAgentDir()` — so anyone who relocated their config dir got a stray `~/.pi` resurrected the first time a `memory: user` agent ran. User-scope memory now resolves to `<agentDir>/agent-memory/<name>` (default `~/.pi/agent/agent-memory/`). Existing memories aren't orphaned: when the legacy `~/.pi/agent-memory/<name>` directory exists and the new location doesn't, it keeps being used — symlinked legacy dirs are ignored, consistent with the file's other symlink defenses — and once the new location exists it wins. Lazy fallback rather than auto-migration, so no files are moved.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **`output_transcript` frontmatter + `outputTranscript` project setting — opt out of a subagent's `.output` transcript** ([#146](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/146) — thanks [@Thoughts-One](https://github.com/Thoughts-One)). Every subagent streams its full conversation to a per-subagent JSON-lines transcript under the OS temp dir (`<tmpdir>/pi-subagents-<uid>/…/<agent-id>.output`, owner-only `0700`, cleared on reboot); until now that write was unconditional. Set `output_transcript: false` on a custom agent to write no transcript file or path for it, or `outputTranscript: false` in `subagents.json` to make transcripts opt-in for the whole project (a custom agent's frontmatter overrides the project default). Useful when run transcripts shouldn't sit on disk for backup or DLP tooling to ingest. Scope is deliberately narrow — it governs only the `.output` transcript, not the persisted pi session (`persist_session`), worktree commits (`isolation: worktree`), or memory files — so keeping a run fully off disk means setting those too. Default is unchanged: with neither flag set, transcripts are written exactly as before. The write decision is centralized on `record.outputFile`, so every downstream consumer (streaming, notifications, the transcript footer) keys off a single gate.

### Fixed
- **Bordered conversation-viewer rows stay exact-width at double-width truncation boundaries** ([#153](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/153) — thanks [@xz-dev](https://github.com/xz-dev)). The conversation viewer pre-pads each row to the inner width and truncates it to fit between the `│` borders, but `truncateToWidth` was called without its `pad` flag — so when a truncation boundary fell mid-way through a double-width character (CJK, wide emoji), the result came back one column short and the right border shifted left by a column on that row. The row builder now truncates with padding on, restoring the trailing column, so every bordered row renders at exactly the box width regardless of where a wide glyph lands. A regression test sweeps a double-width character across every truncation boundary and asserts each rendered line is exactly the requested width.
- **Isolated subagents keep extension-registered custom providers on pi 0.80.8+** (fixes [#151](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/151) via [#152](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/152) — thanks [@0xbentang](https://github.com/0xbentang)). pi 0.80.8 replaced `createAgentSession`'s `modelRegistry` option with `modelRuntime`, and the agent runner still passed the now-ignored `modelRegistry` — so pi built a *fresh* model runtime from disk for the child session. Because isolation also disables extension loading, that fresh runtime had neither the extension-registered custom provider nor its auth: an `isolated: true` agent pinned to such a provider failed preflight with `No API key found for <provider>`, while the same agent with `isolated: false` — or on any pi <0.80.8 — worked. The runner now forwards the parent session's `ModelRuntime` (read off the `ModelRegistry` facade on `ctx.modelRegistry`) as `modelRuntime` when the running pi exposes one, and still passes `modelRegistry` for the pre-0.80.8 range — so the fix spans the whole `>=0.80.0` peer range without changing it: older pi omits the new field and takes the legacy path, 0.80.8+ inherits the parent runtime. Extensions and tools stay isolated exactly as before — only the model providers and their auth are inherited. A `pi@latest` CI job guards the reachability of that runtime accessor (a `private` field the fix reaches through), so a future pi that renames or hides it surfaces as a test failure instead of a silent return of this bug.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **`max` thinking level is now advertised in the frontmatter/tool/wizard choices** ([#147](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/147) — thanks [@justin-ramirez-gametime](https://github.com/justin-ramirez-gametime)). pi 0.80 added `max` to its `ThinkingLevel`, and the extension already forwarded the value unchanged, but the Agent tool description, generated-agent template, `/agents` creation wizard, and README all stopped at `xhigh` — hiding a valid capability. Those four surfaces now come from one shared list so they can't drift behind pi again. Actual availability still depends on the host pi version and the selected model; pi clamps unsupported levels down.

### Fixed
- **Runs whose final assistant turn failed are now reported as `error`, not `completed` with an empty result** (fixes [#144](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/144) — thanks [@possibilities](https://github.com/possibilities) for the diagnosis). pi resolves an exhausted-retries provider failure normally — the final assistant message carries `stopReason: "error"` plus an `errorMessage`, no rejection — so the manager mapped such runs to `completed` and every consumer (foreground tool result, `get_subagent_result`, background notifications, resume, scheduler, RPC events) saw a clean success reading `No output.` — or worse, an *earlier* turn's text presented as the fresh answer, since the history fallback walks past empty messages. The runner now inspects the final assistant message and reports a failure in two cases: the turn stopped with `stopReason "error"`, or it hit the output-token ceiling (`stopReason "length"`) having produced no text at all — a silent max-token death that reproduced the same empty-`No output.` symptom. Status still derives from how the final turn stopped, never from whether earlier turns produced text: empty-but-clean finals (tool-call-only or thinking-only endings) stay `completed`, a `length` stop that *did* produce text is a legitimate truncated answer and stays `completed`, partial-text provider errors are still failures, and the walk-back fallback keeps preserving partial output for aborted/steered runs. (An `aborted` final turn needs no special-casing here — the manager's hard-abort flag and `stopped` guard already surface it as `aborted`/`stopped`.) The response-text collector also no longer resets on user/tool-result `message_start` events (it tracked the last *message*, not the last *assistant* message). A failed run still surfaces any output it *did* produce: the tool result shows `Agent failed: <error>` followed by that text under a `Partial output before the failure:` label — and the history fallback is now bounded to the current invocation, so a failed **resume** no longer returns the *previous* turn's answer as this run's result (it returns empty). **Behavior change:** runs that previously ended `completed` with an empty result now end `error` carrying the provider message, and `subagents:failed` fires where `subagents:completed` did; scheduled jobs record `lastStatus "error"` for them.
- **A subagent can allowlist a package-installed extension by its package name, not just its source directory** (fixes [#143](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/143) — thanks [@possibilities](https://github.com/possibilities)). Our extension-scoping (`extensions:` / `exclude_extensions:` / `tools: ext:…`) named an extension from its file path, and for an `index.ts` entry it used the parent directory — so a package installed via `pi.extensions: ["./src/index.ts"]` (like this one) only ever matched as `src`, an unstable, collision-prone name that no user would guess; `extensions: [pi-subagents]` silently matched nothing. An extension now also answers to its package's unscoped short name (`@tintinweb/pi-subagents` → `pi-subagents`), read from the nearest `package.json` whose `pi.extensions` manifest actually declares that entry. This is an **added alias** — the path-derived name keeps working, so nothing that already matched `src` breaks — and it fires only for genuinely manifest-declared package entries, so a loose extension is never misattributed to a co-located project's name.
- **A pi-subagents activation that a child session filtered out no longer advertises or answers cross-extension RPC** (fixes [#142](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/142) — thanks [@possibilities](https://github.com/possibilities)). pi runs every extension factory *before* applying an agent's `extensions:` filter and only delivers lifecycle events (`session_start`, …) to the survivors, but the `pi.events` bus is shared with the filtered-out activations too. Because we registered the RPC handlers and emitted `subagents:ready` at factory time, a child agent whose `extensions:` omitted pi-subagents still saw a `subagents:ready` broadcast and a successful `subagents:rpc:ping`, yet every `subagents:rpc:spawn` failed with `No active session` — its `session_start` never fired, so the spawn handler had no context. The RPC handler registration and the `subagents:ready` broadcast now happen on the first bound `session_start` instead of at factory time, so a session that excludes pi-subagents stays completely silent on the RPC channels — behaving like a session where it was never installed, rather than advertising a spawn service it can't provide. Emitting readiness after all factories have loaded also closes a latent race where a consumer whose factory ran after ours could miss the event. No change for sessions that do load pi-subagents: `subagents:ready` still fires and RPC still works, just at `session_start`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Project custom agents are also discovered from `.agents/agents/<name>.md`** ([#133](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/133) — thanks [@wenerme](https://github.com/wenerme); closes [#132](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/132)). Projects that keep their agent assets in the shared cross-tool `.agents` workspace (the same convention this extension already reads for `.agents/skills/`) can now define subagents there instead of duplicating files into `.pi/agents/`. Discovery precedence is `global < .agents/agents < .pi/agents`: on a name clash between the two project locations, **`.pi/agents/` wins** — `.pi` remains the project authority, and the `/agents` create/eject/disable flows keep writing there; `.agents/agents/` is a read location only.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Dev/test toolchain now tracks pi 0.80.x; pi peer floor raised to `>=0.80.0`** (as diagnosed by [@philipmw](https://github.com/philipmw) in [#129](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/129)). The committed lockfile had pinned the `@earendil-works/pi-*` peers to 0.75.5 (the latest published when it was generated), so tests and typecheck exercised an older API surface than the pi that actually runs the extension — including 22 tests that silently never ran on 0.75.5 and now do (suite skip count 26 → 4 between the two lockfiles). The lockfile now resolves the peers to 0.80.6, and the test suite imports pi-ai's relocated faux/model helpers (`registerFauxProvider`, `getModel` — `/compat`-only since pi-ai 0.80) through a single re-export module, `test/helpers/pi-ai.ts`, so the next relocation touches one file. Because the test surface no longer resolves on ≤0.75.x, `peerDependencies` move from `>=0.74.0` to `>=0.80.0` to match what is actually tested. Migration: installs under pi <0.80 may emit unmet-peer warnings (or fail under strict peer resolution such as `npm --strict-peer-deps` / pnpm defaults) — upgrade pi to ≥0.80; runtime behavior itself is unchanged on any pi version, since pi substitutes its own bundled modules for extension imports at load time. Live-mode e2e (`PI_E2E_LIVE=1`) now fails fast with a clear error when the pinned `PI_PROVIDER`/`PI_MODEL` isn't in pi-ai's builtin catalog, instead of silently letting the session resolve a different model.

### Fixed
- **Output-file streaming survives session compaction** (fixes [#145](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/145) — thanks [@possibilities](https://github.com/possibilities) for the diagnosis). Compaction replaces `session.messages` with a shorter, summarized array, which stranded the streamer's write index past the new end — the flush loop never matched again and the agent's output file silently froze for the rest of the run, exactly on the long background runs that auto-compact. The streamer now flushes any not-yet-written tail when compaction starts and re-anchors its index to the rebuilt array after a successful compaction — deferred one microtask, because on the overflow-retry path pi trims the trailing error assistant message *after* emitting `compaction_end`, and a synchronous anchor would skip the first post-compaction message. Aborted and failed compactions leave the session untouched and change nothing. Verified against a real pi `AgentSession` driving a real `session.compact()` in the new e2e regression.
- **FleetView no longer steals arrow/Enter/Esc keys from other interactive components** (fixes [#123](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/123) — thanks [@TommyC81](https://github.com/TommyC81) for the report). pi delivers terminal input to extension listeners *before* the focused component, and selector/input dialogs (`ctx.ui.select` & co.) swap the prompt editor out while `getEditorText()` still reads the detached — empty — editor. So while subagents were running, FleetView's empty-prompt gate passed and it consumed the navigation keys that belonged to whatever dialog was actually focused: other extensions' pickers (e.g. rpiv-ask-user-question), pi's own menus, and even `/agents → Settings` itself. FleetView now checks that pi's prompt editor is the focused component before touching any key (pi's editor is an `Editor` subclass; every dialog is not), and an in-progress list navigation is dropped the moment something else takes focus. Unknowable focus errs toward the editor, so list activation keeps working; non-`Editor` custom editor components simply flow keys through untouched.
- **Widget and viewer lines keep their dim styling after nested color annotations** ([#136](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/136) — thanks [@xz-dev](https://github.com/xz-dev)). pi themes close a foreground color with a bare `\x1b[39m`, so the threshold-colored context-fill percent inside `formatSessionTokens` (warning at ≥70%, error at ≥85%) also terminated the surrounding dim style — the closing `)` and any following text on the widget's running-agent line and the conversation-viewer header bled to the terminal's default color. A small `fgPreservingNestedStyles` helper re-opens the outer color after each nested reset (derived from the theme itself, so it stays theme-agnostic and is a no-op under `NO_COLOR`).
- **`get_subagent_result` with `wait: true` now waits for queued agents** ([#127](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/127) — thanks [@benrhodeland](https://github.com/benrhodeland)). A background agent past the concurrency ceiling sits in the queue with no run promise yet, so the wait path (gated on `status === "running" && record.promise`) skipped it and returned `No output.` immediately — the orchestrator read a queued agent as "finished with nothing". The wait now also covers `queued`: it polls until the queue starts (or stops) the agent, then awaits the run like any running agent. Most visible with parallel background spawns in one message, where spawns beyond `maxConcurrent` (default 4) queue.
- **Subagent activations no longer clobber the `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` registry** ([#128](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/128) — thanks [@benrhodeland](https://github.com/benrhodeland)). Child sessions re-activate the extension in the same process (`session.bindExtensions` in the agent runner), and every activation overwrote the global registry slot — pointing cross-package consumers (RPC extensions, headless hosts) at a short-lived child manager whose shutdown could then delete the root session's entry entirely. The first activation now claims the slot, child activations leave it alone, and only the owning activation releases it (identity-checked) on shutdown.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Steer a running agent from the conversation viewer.** The live conversation overlay (FleetView's `Enter`, or `/agents → Running agents`) now lets you redirect an agent without leaving the view: press `Enter` to open an inline composer, type a message, `Enter` to send — `Esc` or an empty submit just returns. The message is delivered through the same path as the `steer_subagent` tool (`AgentManager.steer()` → `session.steer`, or queued onto `pendingSteers` if the session isn't ready yet), so it appears as a user message and redirects the agent after its current tool execution; feedback is the message showing up in the live transcript you're already watching. The affordance is offered only while the agent is still running/queued (mirrors the `x`/stop affordance), and the viewer stays modal — every existing shortcut (`x`/`x` stop, arrows/`j`/`k` scroll, `q` close) is untouched, and `Enter` was previously inert here so nothing is overridden. The idle footer was reorganized to actions-left / navigation-right so the full scroll-key hint (`↑↓ scroll · PgUp/PgDn or Shift+↑↓ · Esc close`) stays fully visible down to 80-column terminals; the `N lines · %` readout returns on the left whenever there's spare width.
- **Forgiving model resolution for agent `model:` pins.** `resolveModel` now tolerates cosmetic id variations and falls back across providers, so a qualified or date-pinned config resolves widely instead of silently dropping to the parent model: `.` and `-` are treated as equivalent in version numbers (`claude-haiku-4.5` ≡ `claude-haiku-4-5`); a trailing `-YYYYMMDD` date stamp is optional (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` matches an undated registry id); and a `provider/modelId` that isn't available under the named provider retries the bare id against every provider (the named provider is still preferred when present). An exact match still wins over a tolerant one, so dated snapshots aren't conflated — the precedence is exact → fuzzy-under-named-provider → same model under any provider → unavailable.
- **`/agents → Agent types` shows each agent's full description and what its model resolves to.** The list now renders with `SettingsList` (like the Settings menu) instead of a flat selector: the highlighted agent's full description shows on its own line below the list, so long descriptions no longer wrap and push the agent names out of alignment. The model column shows the configured model, flags it `(unavailable, fallback: inherit)` when it can't be resolved against the registry (it would silently inherit the parent model at runtime), and surfaces the resolved target `(→ provider/id)` when resolution lands on a different provider or version than configured.
- **`widgetMode` setting — control what the above-editor widget shows: `all` / `background` / `off`** ([#117](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/117) — thanks [@Alan-TheGentleman](https://github.com/Alan-TheGentleman); fixes [#118](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/118)). Foreground agents already render inline as the `Agent` tool result, so also listing them in the persistent widget double-rendered the same run (most visible in tmux/zellij). `widgetMode` (via `/agents → Settings → Widget`, or `subagents.json`) selects the widget's contents: `all` shows every agent (the previous behavior), `background` shows background/queued/scheduled/RPC runs but hides foreground, and `off` hides the widget entirely (agents still appear inline and in FleetView). Applied live — toggling refreshes immediately. Filtering keys off a new tri-state `AgentRecord.isBackground` captured at spawn (`true` = background, `false` = foreground, `undefined` = undeclared, e.g. a cross-extension RPC spawn), independent of the UI-only `invocation` snapshot — so scheduler- and RPC-spawned background agents stay visible instead of vanishing; only runs *known* to be foreground are dropped. The running-status line was also refactored from one multiline `Text` into two component rows, so rapid partial updates replace cleanly instead of leaving stale rows behind in terminal multiplexers — identical on-screen output, no more ghost lines.

### Changed
- **The built-in `Explore` agent's model pin is now `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`** (was `…-4-5-20251001`). The stale date stamp is dropped to match the `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` / `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` convention used by the create-agent wizard; combined with the forgiving resolution above, `Explore` now picks up its fast/cheap model across registry variations (dated, undated, dotted, or under a non-`anthropic` provider) instead of silently falling back to the parent model.
- **The above-editor widget now hides foreground agents by default** (`widgetMode` defaults to `background`). Foreground runs still render inline as the `Agent` tool result (and in FleetView); set `/agents → Settings → Widget` to `all` to restore the previous show-everything view, or `off` to hide the widget. Existing `subagents.json` files load unchanged (absent → `background`).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **FleetView — a Claude Code-style subagent navigator below the editor.** A persistent, navigable list of `main` + every active subagent renders beneath the editor whenever agents are running — **auto-shown, no keypress needed** — mirroring Claude Code's bottom fleet bar: `⏺`/`◯` selection markers, agent type + description, right-aligned `elapsed · ↓ tokens`, and a `↓ N more` overflow once past five rows. Press `↓` (or `←`) at an **empty prompt** to move focus into the list, `↑`/`↓` to select, `Enter` to open the selected agent's live, auto-updating conversation overlay, and `Esc` (or `↑` above `main`) to return to the prompt. Implemented as a `belowEditor` widget with all key handling routed through `onTerminalInput` (which fires before the editor); it only captures arrow keys at an empty prompt — and acts on key-**press** only (kitty-protocol release events are ignored, otherwise each tap moved twice) — so typing, history, and cursor movement are untouched. Rows are ordered **earliest-launched first**; only openable agents (those with a session) are shown, so pending/queued agents appear once they start and `Enter` never dead-ends; **finished agents linger ~4s** before dropping out (their elapsed freezes at completion); and a viewer **stays open through its agent's completion** so the final output remains readable. Selection follows the viewed agent by id, so closing a viewer returns you to the same agent even if the list reordered while it was open. Every rendered line is width-clamped — the narrow-terminal crash/flicker class previously fixed in v0.2.7 and [#7](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/7). Toggle via `/agents → Settings → Fleet view` (default on; pure-UI, so no LLM-context cost).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **`persist_session` / `session_dir` agent frontmatter — persist a subagent as a real pi session** ([#111](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/111) — thanks [@codesoda](https://github.com/codesoda)). `persist_session: true` runs the subagent through `SessionManager.create(...)` instead of `SessionManager.inMemory(...)`, so its full transcript is written to pi's normal session location (`~/.pi/agent/sessions`) — inspectable and resumable after the fact, like a top-level session — rather than living in memory only. Useful for long-running, multi-round orchestrations (plan → review → implement → verify) where each subagent's conversation is worth keeping. `session_dir` optionally overrides where the persisted session is written (absolute, `~`, or agent-cwd-relative path); omitted, persistence follows pi's own precedence — `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, then the settings manager's `getSessionDir()`, then pi's default location. Both default off/unset, so existing agents are unchanged: the in-memory path is byte-identical to before, and the sidechain `.output` transcript is still written either way.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Background agent records lost before result is read** ([#108](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/108) — thanks [@philipmw](https://github.com/philipmw)). On session switch or `/new`/`/resume`, `clearCompleted()` removed completed agent records regardless of whether the LLM had retrieved the result, causing `get_subagent_result` to return "Agent not found" for agents that had finished but hadn't been checked yet. `clearCompleted()` now accepts a `skipUnconsumed` flag; session event handlers pass `true`, so records with `resultConsumed=false` are preserved across session transitions. The 10-minute cleanup timer handles eventual eviction. Note: a full session shutdown (`session_shutdown`) calls `dispose()` which clears all records unconditionally — that path is not affected by this fix.

### Added
- **Foreground agent lifecycle completion and conversation logging** ([#105](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/105) — thanks [@benrhodeland](https://github.com/benrhodeland)). Two gaps closed: (1) **`onComplete` now fires for foreground agents**, emitting `subagents:completed` / `subagents:failed` lifecycle events and writing a `subagents:record` entry to the parent JSONL — previously only background agents emitted these, leaving cross-extension observers with an orphaned `subagents:started` event and no matching completion. `resultConsumed` is pre-set so the callback skips notifications (the result is returned inline); no change to the tool's return value. (2) **Foreground agent conversations are now streamed to `.output` files** (same `.pi/output/agent-<id>.jsonl` path as background agents) — inline subagent transcripts were previously permanently lost after `spawnAndWait` returned.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`SpawnOptions.cwd` — spawn a subagent in a different working directory** ([#96](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/96) — thanks [@madeleineostoja](https://github.com/madeleineostoja)). For RPC/programmatic callers (not exposed on the `Agent` tool — the LLM-visible surface is unchanged). The agent's tools operate in the target directory and the prompt's environment block describes it, but **`.pi` config keeps loading from the parent session's project** (new `RunOptions.configCwd` split): the target's `.pi` extensions never execute, and its agents/skills/settings/memory are not picked up — spawning into an untrusted directory sends a worker there with the parent's toolbox, rather than "opening pi there." Composes with `isolation: "worktree"`: the worktree is created *from* the target directory's repo, the agent works at the equivalent subdirectory inside the copy (a monorepo-package cwd keeps its scoping instead of silently widening to the repo root — new `WorktreeInfo.workPath`), and the resulting `pi-agent-*` branch lands in that repo, with the completion message naming it so the orchestrator merges in the right place. Validation is strict, typed, and early — non-strings, relative paths, nonexistent paths, and files all throw curated errors at `spawn()` (before queueing) and are re-checked at queue drain, surfacing as RPC error envelopes (`null` is treated as unset). On dispose, worktree registrations are pruned in every repo that received one; only a hard crash can leave a stale entry (then: `git worktree prune` in the target repo).

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **`exclude_extensions:` agent frontmatter — extension denylist for subagents** ([#94](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/94) — thanks [@ramhaidar](https://github.com/ramhaidar)). Applied after the `extensions:` include set; exclude wins, including over `tools: ext:` selectors (an excluded extension never loads, so its `ext:` reference becomes the usual orphan warning). The key use case: `extensions: true` + `exclude_extensions: pi-notify` — all extensions except a noisy one, without hand-maintaining an allowlist. Plain canonical names only (case-insensitive); paths, `*`, and unmatched names fire `extension-error:…` warnings (warn-not-abort, as with `extensions:` mismatches); `extensions: false` + an exclude warns that the exclude has no effect. **Not a sandbox:** excluded extensions' factory code still executes once during loading — exclusion suppresses handler binding and tool registration, not load-time side effects. The negation syntax `extensions: ["*", "!name"]` was deliberately rejected: an unquoted `!name` is a YAML tag and silently mis-parses.
- **`toolDescriptionMode` setting — opt-in compact Agent tool description** ([#91](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/91) — thanks [@tiberiuichim](https://github.com/tiberiuichim)). The full Claude Code-style description costs ~1,400 tokens with the default agents and grows with each custom agent (the type list embeds full agent descriptions) — significant for small/local models. `toolDescriptionMode: "compact"` (via `/agents → Settings → Tool description` or `subagents.json`) swaps in a ~75% smaller description: one-line type list (first sentence of each agent description), terse usage notes, per-option details left to the parameter descriptions. Default `"full"` is byte-identical to before — the rich description's guardrails are deliberately load-bearing and stay the default. A third mode, `"custom"`, registers a user-authored description from `<cwd>/.pi/agent-tool-description.md` (project) or `<agentDir>/agent-tool-description.md` (global; project wins), with `{{placeholder}}` substitution keeping the dynamic parts live — `{{typeList}}`, `{{compactTypeList}}`, `{{agentDir}}`, `{{scheduleGuideline}}` — so a hand-written description can't drift out of sync with the registered agents (the advertised-vs-spawnable staleness [#92](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/92) just fixed). Unknown placeholders are left verbatim with a stderr warning; a missing/empty file falls back to `"full"`. Only the prose is customizable — the parameter schema stays code-owned. A ready-made starting point ships at `examples/agent-tool-description.md`, reproducing the full description exactly (CI-enforced byte-identical, so the example can't go stale). Like `schedulingEnabled`, the mode is read at tool registration — changing it applies on the next pi session. The issue's original ask (move the description to a skill) isn't possible in pi: tools must register their description in the tool schema for the model to call them; skills are lazily-loaded instructions, not tool registrations.

### Fixed
- **Conversation viewer honors custom `tui.select.*` keybindings** ([#99](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/99) — thanks [@owenniles](https://github.com/owenniles)). The viewer hardcoded its scroll keys and discarded the `KeybindingsManager` pi injects into `ctx.ui.custom()`, so user bindings (e.g. emacs-style `ctrl+p`/`ctrl+n` on `tui.select.up`/`down`) worked in pi core selectors but not here. Scrolling now resolves through `tui.select.up`/`down`/`pageUp`/`pageDown`; the viewer-specific `k`/`j` and `shift+arrow` aliases still work alongside, and behavior without custom bindings is unchanged (the `tui.select.*` defaults are the previously hardcoded keys).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **`disableDefaultAgents` setting** ([#92](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/92) — thanks [@TommyC81](https://github.com/TommyC81)). When on, the three built-in default agents (general-purpose, Explore, Plan) are skipped at registration — only user-defined `.pi/agents/*.md` agents are advertised and spawnable. User agents are unaffected, including ones overriding a default by name; with no user agents defined, spawning falls back to the hardcoded generic config. Off by default; toggle via `/agents → Settings → Disable defaults` or `disableDefaultAgents` in `subagents.json`. Like `schedulingEnabled`, the Agent tool's type list reflects the change on the next pi session (tool schema is registered at startup).

### Fixed
- **Agents with `enabled: false` are no longer advertised in the Agent tool description** ([#92](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/92)). `buildTypeListText` listed every registered agent, including disabled ones that `isValidType` then refused to spawn — the LLM was offered types it could never use. The type list now filters through `getAvailableTypes()`, matching the `subagent_type` parameter description.
- **Agent tool type list no longer built from pre-settings state.** The description text was captured into a variable before persisted settings were applied; it's now built at tool-registration time, after `subagents:settings_loaded`.
- **Committed work from `isolation: "worktree"` subagents is now preserved** ([#68](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/68) — thanks [@rylwin](https://github.com/rylwin)). If an isolated subagent creates its own commit, cleanup previously saw a clean `git status`, treated it as "no changes", and removed the detached worktree — silently discarding the commits. The worktree now records its base SHA at creation, and cleanup creates the expected `pi-agent-*` branch whenever HEAD moved past it, even with a clean tree.
- **Automatic commits in isolated worktrees skip local Git hooks** ([#68](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/68)). The preservation commit at worktree cleanup now uses `--no-verify`, so a failing local pre-commit hook can't abort it (which previously surfaced as `hasChanges: false` — the agent's work lost).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-01

> **⚠️ Breaking: `extensions:` and `tools:` in agent frontmatter semantics changed.** The `extensions: [...]` array now selects which extensions *load*, not which tool names surface. Agents that previously used the array form will behave differently — see migration below. The `tools:` field also grew new `ext:` and `*` selector forms; existing `tools:` values without these selectors are unchanged.
> - `extensions: [...]` is now an **extension allowlist applied at load time**, not a tool-name substring filter. Each entry is an extension *name*, a *path* (absolute, `~/`-prefixed, or relative-to-cwd), or `"*"`. **Migration:** `extensions: ["mcp"]` previously loaded *every* extension and then surfaced only tools whose names contained `mcp`. To keep all extensions, use `extensions: true` or `extensions: "*"`. To narrow, name the extensions or point at their files. `"*"` composes: `extensions: "*, /abs/path/extra-ext.ts"` is all defaults plus one path-loaded.
> - `tools:` now accepts `ext:` selectors and `*`. **Gotcha:** a `tools:` value containing **only** `ext:` entries yields **zero built-in tools** — add `*` (e.g. `tools: "*, ext:foo"`) to keep the built-ins. And **any** `ext:` entry flips extension tools to an explicit allowlist (non-listed extensions stay loaded but expose no tools). A `tools:` with no `ext:` entries is unchanged.
> - **`extensions:` is the sole loading authority.** `ext:foo` only narrows tool *exposure* within the already-loaded set; it cannot pull an extension in. `extensions: false` + `tools: "ext:foo"` loads nothing and warns that `ext:foo` is orphaned. To expose one extension's tool from an otherwise-narrow agent, name the extension explicitly: `extensions: [foo]` + `tools: "ext:foo/bar"`.

> **⚠️ Heads-up — widget glyphs changed (visual only):** turn count now renders as `↻N` (was `⟳N`) and compaction count as `⇊N` (was `↻N`). Fix for [#84](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/84) — `⟳` overflowed its cell in common monospace fonts. **No API, behavior, or output-format changes — only the glyphs.** If you grep agent stats lines or pipe widget output through scripts, update your patterns: `⟳` → `↻` (turns), `↻` → `⇊` (compactions).

### Added
- **`tools:` accepts `ext:` extension-tool selectors and a `*` built-in wildcard.** Entries in the `tools:` CSV are now partitioned: plain names are the built-in allowlist (unchanged); `*` expands to all built-ins (symmetric with `extensions: "*"`); `ext:foo` / `ext:foo/bar` select extension tools. **Any `ext:` entry flips extension tools to an explicit allowlist** — only tools named by an `ext:` selector reach the LLM, and extensions not named stay loaded (their `session_start` etc. handlers still fire) but expose no tools. `ext:foo` exposes all of `foo`'s tools; `ext:foo/bar` narrows `foo` to just `bar` (multiple `ext:foo/x` entries union; a bare `ext:foo` alongside `ext:foo/bar` lets narrowing win). `ext:` is **narrowing-only** — it does not load extensions. `extensions:` remains the sole loading authority; an `ext:foo` against an extension that `extensions:` excluded (including `extensions: false`) is orphaned and warns via `onToolActivity` (`extension-error:ext:foo …`). With no `ext:` entry present, extension-tool behaviour is unchanged. `ext:` is name-only (matched by canonical name, so it composes with path-loaded extensions); paths still go in `extensions:`. `isolated: true` ignores `ext:` selectors.
- **Stop a running agent from the conversation viewer.** In `/agents → Running agents`, select an agent and press `x` (then `x` again to confirm) to abort it. The two-press guard prevents an accidental kill; the footer shows `x stop` → `x again to STOP`. This works for **background** agents — which a global `Esc` can't unambiguously target — while `Esc` still stops a blocking foreground `Agent` call. Wires the existing `AgentManager.abort(id)` to the viewer (`onStop` callback); the affordance only appears while the agent is `running`/`queued`. Addresses the common "how do I stop a background subagent?" question ([#88](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/88)).

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `extensions: [...]` in agent frontmatter is now a loader-level extension allowlist, not a tool-name filter.** Previously a `string[]` value filtered exposed *tool names* by substring (`t.startsWith(e) || t.includes(e)`) while every discovered extension still loaded and ran its handlers. Now each entry selects an *extension*: a bare name keeps the matching default-discovered extension, a path (absolute, `~/`-prefixed, or relative-to-cwd) loads that extension fresh via `additionalExtensionPaths`, and `"*"` keeps all default-discovered extensions. Entries compose — `["*", "/abs/foo.ts"]` is all defaults plus foo, `["mcp", "/abs/foo.ts"]` is just those two. Excluded extensions no longer bind handlers or register tools (their factory still runs once during `reload()`). Directory extensions (`foo/index.ts`) match by the parent directory name. **Extension names match case-insensitively** (`extensions: [Mcp]` resolves the same as `[mcp]`); tool names within `ext:foo/bar` selectors remain case-sensitive (they're matched against pi-mono's registered identifiers). Unmatched names and failed paths warn via `onToolActivity` but do not abort the subagent (see the heads-up above for migration).
- **Non-normal subagent outcomes are now stated explicitly in the text delivered to the parent**, so the orchestrator can't mistake a stopped/incomplete agent for a completed one. The foreground `Agent` result, `get_subagent_result`, and the `<task-notification>` summary all append a clear note for `stopped` (user abort) → `(STOPPED BY THE USER before completion — output is partial; the task was NOT finished)`, `aborted` (turn limit) → `(aborted — hit the turn limit before completion; output may be incomplete)`, and `steered` → `(wrapped up at the turn limit — output may be partial)`. `stopped` (human intervention) is kept distinct from `aborted` (turn-budget cutoff); a clean `completed` adds no note. Extracted as `getStatusNote` in `src/status-note.ts`.
- **`BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES` is derived from pi's tool factories** (`createCodingTools` + `createReadOnlyTools`) rather than a hardcoded list, so the built-in set tracks pi-mono automatically. Internal; no behavior change (the resolved set is the same seven names).

### Fixed
- **Turn-count glyph in the agent widget no longer overflows its monospace cell** ([#84](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/84) — thanks [@linozen](https://github.com/linozen)). `formatTurns` used `⟳` (U+27F3 CLOCKWISE GAPPED CIRCLE ARROW) from the Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A block, where common monospace fonts (Iosevka Nerd Font Mono, Menlo, SF Mono, JetBrains Mono) draw the glyph visually wider than one cell despite its Neutral East Asian Width — making the next character (the digit) overlap the glyph. Replaced with `↻` (U+21BB CLOCKWISE OPEN CIRCLE ARROW) from the standard Arrows block, which renders cleanly at one cell in those fonts. To avoid colliding with the existing compaction indicator (which previously also used `↻`), the compaction glyph moves to `⇊` (U+21CA DOWNWARDS PAIRED ARROWS) — same Arrows block, also single-cell, visually distinct. Widget vocabulary now reads: `↻5≤30` for turns, `⇊2` for compactions. Pi UI consumers / scripts grepping for the glyph in stats lines must update.
- **`tools: none` now actually yields zero built-in tools.** `getToolNamesForType` treated an explicit empty `builtinToolNames` (`[]`, produced by `tools: none`) as "unspecified" and fell back to all 7 built-ins. It now distinguishes an omitted field (`undefined` → all built-ins, for default agents) from an explicit empty list (`[]` → zero), consistent with `getConfig`. Same fix makes `tools:` values containing only `ext:` selectors yield zero built-ins as documented.
- **`tools:` typos no longer silently break tool-calling** ([#75](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/75)). Two parts: (a) `all` was previously parsed as a literal tool name, producing a one-element allowlist of the non-existent tool `"all"` — the model then returned an empty response or emitted raw XML tool calls, all with `status: completed` and no error. `parseToolsField` now treats `all` (case-insensitive) as an alias for the `*` wildcard, both standalone and inside a CSV. (b) Plain entries in `tools:` are expected to be built-in names (extension tools route through `ext:`), so an unknown name there is unambiguously a typo. `runAgent` now emits a `tools-error:tool "X" requested by agent "Y" is not a known built-in` event via `onToolActivity` for each unrecognized plain entry — same surfacing channel as the existing `extension-error:` warnings.
- **Subagents with `extensions: true` now actually expose extension-registered tools (MCP, etc.)** ([#47](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/47)). `runAgent` previously passed only the built-in tool names as the `tools:` allowlist to `createAgentSession`, so pi-mono's `allowedToolNames` gate rejected every extension-registered tool at registration — `extensions: true` agents silently got only the 7 built-ins. `runAgent` now enumerates extension tool names from the resource loader after `reload()` and builds the full master allowlist (built-ins + permitted extension tools), so pi-mono's gate admits them from the first instant of the session. `disallowedTools` and the internal `Agent`/`get_subagent_result`/`steer_subagent` exclusions are applied uniformly to built-in and extension tools at construction — no post-construction `setActiveToolsByName` narrowing.
- **Append-mode subagents no longer defeat the LLM's KV cache** ([#73](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/73) — reported by [@jeffutter](https://github.com/jeffutter)). The assembled child prompt placed the per-spawn-varying `<active_agent>` tag and `# Environment` block *before* the ~8k-token inherited parent prompt, and wrapped the parent prompt in `<inherited_system_prompt>` tags. Because KV caches key on a byte-identical prefix, every subagent spawn reprocessed all ~8k shared tokens from scratch (~40s on slower hardware). The parent prompt is now emitted **verbatim at the start** of the prompt (wrapper dropped), so it forms an identical, cacheable prefix with the parent session and across every spawn; the static `<sub_agent_context>` bridge follows, then the varying `<active_agent>` tag and env block. `replace` mode is unchanged (it inherits no parent prefix). The `<active_agent>` tag stays present and is parsed position-independently, so downstream permission resolution is unaffected. Mirrors the fix in [gotgenes/pi-packages#180](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/issues/180).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` now surface in pi's default system prompt** ([#87](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/87) — thanks [@that-yolanda](https://github.com/that-yolanda)). Adds `promptSnippet` to all three (a line in the prompt's `Available tools:` section) and `promptGuidelines` to `Agent` (bullets in `Guidelines:`). The tools were always callable via the tool-call API; this only adds system-prompt reinforcement for prompt-following models. No schema or tool-call changes.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-30

> **Heads-up — orchestrator behavior may shift.** This release substantially rewrites the `Agent` tool description and the three default-agent descriptions (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`) to mirror Claude Code's upstream wording. No API, schema, or tool-call shape changes — purely a prompt-engineering shift, but a load-bearing one:
> - **Agent selection may drift.** The new agent descriptions carry richer positive ("Use it to …") and negative ("Do NOT use it for …") guidance plus search-breadth hints for `Explore` (`"quick"` / `"medium"` / `"very thorough"`). For ambiguous tasks where the orchestrator previously picked one default agent, it may now pick another — typically more correctly, but the choice may differ from prior releases.
> - **Subagent briefings will skew longer and more contextual.** The restored upstream guardrails and the new `## Writing the prompt` section actively coach "smart colleague who just walked into the room"-style prompts. Expect more context, more constraint, more upfront framing in the `prompt:` field the orchestrator passes to subagents.
> - **Parallel/background patterns more strongly enforced.** The merged bullet on parallel execution now explicitly says `run_in_background: true` is required on each tool call for actual concurrency, and that the orchestrator MUST send a single message with multiple tool uses when the user says "in parallel." Workflows relying on sequential-foreground default behavior are unaffected.
> - If you have tests or workflows that depend on the prior agent-selection or briefing behavior, pin to a v0.7.x release.

### Added
- **`scopeModels` setting — opt-in subagent model-scope enforcement** (off by default). New setting toggleable via `/agents → Settings → Scope models`. When enabled, the *effective* model of each subagent spawn is validated against `enabledModels` from pi's settings (which pi manages via its own `/scoped-models` UI; pi-subagents only reads it). **Both pi settings files are honored**: global `<agentDir>/settings.json` plus project-local `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json`, with project overriding global — mirrors pi's `SettingsManager` deep-merge and our own `subagents.json` precedence. Out-of-scope handling depends on source: caller-supplied via `Agent({ model: "..." })` → hard error to the orchestrator with the allowed list; frontmatter-pinned or parent-inherited → warning toast + the agent runs anyway (preserves "frontmatter is authoritative" guarantee from v0.5.1; `scopeModels` is a guardrail against runtime LLM choices, not user-level config). Limitation: only exact `provider/modelId` entries in `enabledModels` are honored — globs (`*sonnet*`), bare model IDs, and `:thinking` suffixes that pi itself supports are silently dropped here. Matches pi's `/scoped-models` picker output, so the limitation is invisible to UI users.

### Changed
- **`Agent` tool prompt restructured to mirror Claude Code's upstream Agent tool description format.** Section headings now match upstream (`## When not to use`, `## Usage notes`, `## Writing the prompt`); the auto-generated agent list renders as a flat list (no `Default agents:` / `Custom agents:` sub-headers) with a per-agent `(Tools: …)` suffix derived from each agent's `builtinToolNames` (or `*` when the agent has the full built-in set). Restored upstream's load-bearing guardrails that were missing or compressed in the old prompt: "result is not visible to the user → summarize", "trust but verify", "fresh agent / self-contained prompt" on resume, "tell the agent whether to write code or do research", "use proactively when the description says so", "MUST send a single message for parallel", and the worktree auto-cleanup behavior detail. The three redundant "Use Explore / Plan / general-purpose for …" shorthand bullets were dropped — the agent descriptions themselves now carry the canonical (and richer) selection guidance. Upstream's two `<example>` blocks at the end of "Writing the prompt" are also intentionally omitted: the per-orchestrator-turn token cost is recurring, the abstract guidance + the now-rich agent descriptions cover the same pedagogical ground, and the examples embed Anthropic-specific `<thinking>` framing that doesn't generalize across pi-ai's provider surface (OpenAI, Bedrock, Gemini, Mistral, …). All pi-specific bullets (`resume`, `steer_subagent`, `model`, `thinking`, `inherit_context`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `${scheduleGuideline}`) preserved.
- **Default agent descriptions (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`) replaced with upstream Claude Code's verbatim wording.** Previously one-line labels (e.g. `"Fast codebase exploration agent (read-only)"`); now multi-sentence descriptions that include positive ("Use it to …") and negative ("Do NOT use it for …") guidance plus, for Explore, search-breadth hints (`"quick"` / `"medium"` / `"very thorough"`). The LLM-facing selection signal is now substantially stronger.
- **`/agents → Eject` now emits YAML-safe `description:` frontmatter.** The new Explore description contains a `: ` colon-space pattern (the search-breadth hint) and embedded quote characters — emitting it raw would have produced malformed frontmatter that the `yaml` parser would mis-parse. `ejectAgent` now wraps the description with `JSON.stringify` (a valid YAML 1.2 double-quoted scalar), so any description string round-trips cleanly through eject → re-load. Latent bug: previously unreachable because old descriptions were YAML-plain-safe.
- **`/agents → Settings` UI rewritten to inline-editable `SettingsList`.** Replaces the previous modal `ctx.ui.select` chain. All settings visible at once; `↑`/`↓` to navigate, `Space` to cycle preset values on numerics (`Max concurrency`, `Default max turns`, `Grace turns`), `Enter` to type a custom value, `Esc` to exit. Functionally equivalent — same fields, same valid ranges, same persistence behavior — but the interaction model is different. Users scripting against the old screen flow may notice.
- **`.gitignore` additions.** Added `.pi/subagents.json` (project-local subagents settings — written by `/agents → Settings`, shouldn't be committed) plus pi-runtime working files (`progress.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`). **Migration:** if you previously committed `.pi/subagents.json` to your repo, run `git rm --cached .pi/subagents.json` to untrack — gitignore only blocks new additions.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-26

> **⚠️ Breaking: peer dependencies moved from `@mariozechner/pi-*` to `@earendil-works/pi-*`.** The upstream Pi runtime relocated npm scopes on 2026-05-07; the `@mariozechner/pi-*` packages are deprecated. This release pins `@earendil-works/pi-{ai,coding-agent,tui}` at `>=0.74.0`. Hosts on the old scope must update their pi installation first (`pi update --self` handles the rename automatically) before installing this version.
>
> **Note on Node:** this release is tested against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@latest` (currently `0.75.x`), which requires Node `>=22.19.0` because its bundled `undici` calls Node 22+ APIs. CI runs on Node 22. The peer range (`>=0.74.0`) technically also matches the upstream `legacy-node20` line (`0.74.x`, Node 20 compatible) and this extension contains no Node 22+ API calls of its own, but the legacy line is not exercised in CI — consumers pinning it do so at their own risk.

### Changed
- **Peer deps migrated from `@mariozechner/pi-*` to `@earendil-works/pi-*`** ([#76](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/76) — thanks [@SEHANTA](https://github.com/SEHANTA) for the report). On **2026-05-07** the upstream Pi runtime moved npm scopes — `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@0.73.1` was the final publish (now deprecated on npm), and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.74.0` shipped 30 minutes later from the same monorepo (same author, same code). `peerDependencies` now target `@earendil-works/pi-{ai,coding-agent,tui}` at `>=0.74.0`, and all `src/**` and `test/**` imports are renamed to the new scope — pure rename, no API changes. Consumers pinning the new scope no longer hit the peer-dep conflict warnings reported in [#76](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/76).
- **`ThinkingLevel` now imported from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` instead of `…/pi-agent-core`.** `src/types.ts` previously reached past the public API into `pi-agent-core` (an internal package), which only resolved because npm flat-hoisted it as a transitive of `pi-coding-agent` — under pnpm or strict-resolver setups the import failed (`TS2307: Cannot find module '@mariozechner/pi-agent-core'`). `pi-ai` re-exports `ThinkingLevel` from its public surface (`export * from "./types.ts"`), so the import goes through the documented entry point and no extra peer dep is needed.

### Fixed
- **`.pi/subagent-schedules/` is no longer created in every working directory.** `ScheduleStore`'s constructor previously ran `mkdirSync` unconditionally, so any session with scheduling enabled left an empty `.pi/subagent-schedules/` dir behind even when nothing was ever scheduled. Directory creation is now lazy — deferred to a new private `ensureDir()` invoked at the top of `withLock`, so the dir (and its `<sessionId>.json`) appear only when a job is actually persisted. Additionally, `update`/`remove` now short-circuit on an unknown id (in-memory `jobs.has(id)` check) before taking the lock, so no-op mutations never touch disk. Read-only use (`list`/`get`/`hasName`) and constructing the store never create the dir. Pre-existing leftover dirs are not cleaned up — remove them manually.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **`<active_agent name="…"/>` tag prepended to every child system prompt** ([#73](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/73) — thanks [@chris-lasher](https://github.com/chris-lasher)). `buildAgentPrompt` now emits `<active_agent name="${config.name}"/>` as the first line of the assembled prompt in both `replace` and `append` modes, before the env block. Downstream extensions (e.g. permission/policy systems) can parse it from inside the child session to resolve per-agent policy. The tag uses the agent's `config.name` verbatim — no escaping or normalization — and does not couple this extension to any specific downstream consumer; ignoring it is harmless.

### Changed
- **Subagent sessions now get a stable, type-derived name with an id suffix for parallel spawns** ([#51](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/51) — thanks [@forcepushdev](https://github.com/forcepushdev)). `runAgent` calls `session.setSessionName(agentConfig?.name ?? type)`, and when the manager assigns an `agentId` (always, in production), the name is suffixed with an 8-char slice — e.g. `Explore#a1b2c3d4` — so concurrent spawns of the same agent type are distinguishable in the overlay instead of all collapsing onto the same bare name. Direct `runAgent` callers without an `agentId` (e.g. tests) get the bare name.

### Fixed
- **Cross-extension spawn RPC now accepts a string `options.model`** ([#59](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/59), fixes [#60](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/60)). Cross-extension callers (e.g. `@tintinweb/pi-tasks@>=0.4.3`'s `TaskExecute`) naturally forward `model` as a serializable `"provider/modelId"` string. Previously the spawn handler passed strings straight through to `runAgent()`, which expects a `Model` object — the spawned agent then crashed with `No API key found for undefined`. The handler now resolves strings via the same `resolveModel(ctx.modelRegistry)` path the scheduler uses; `Model` objects pass through unchanged. Unresolved strings surface the human-readable `Model not found: "…"` error instead of the auth-lookup crash. Thanks @any-victor.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-12

> **Heads-up — behavior changes in skill preloading:**
> - **`.txt` and extensionless flat skill files are no longer loaded.** Only `<name>.md` flat files and `<name>/SKILL.md` directory skills resolve now. Rename any `<name>.txt` or extensionless skill files to `<name>.md`.

### Added
- **Pi-standard `<name>/SKILL.md` directory layout** is now discovered alongside flat `<name>.md` files. Top-level and nested matches both resolve via BFS — for skill `foo`, the loader checks `<root>/foo/SKILL.md`, then recursively descends looking for `*/.../foo/SKILL.md`. Recursion skips dotfile directories and `node_modules`; a directory that itself contains `SKILL.md` is treated as a single skill (Pi's "skills don't nest" rule).
- **Five discovery roots**, checked in precedence order:
  - `<cwd>/.pi/skills/` (project, Pi)
  - `<cwd>/.agents/skills/` (project, [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills))
  - `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills/` — default `~/.pi/agent/skills/` (user, Pi)
  - `~/.agents/skills/` (user, Agent Skills spec)
  - `~/.pi/skills/` (legacy global, kept for backward compatibility)
- **Symlink rejection broadened** to the new layouts: symlinked skill roots, nested skill directories, and `SKILL.md` files inside otherwise-real directories are all rejected (intentional deviation from Pi, which follows symlinks).
- **Deterministic traversal order** — entries are sorted byte-order so collisions resolve identically across filesystems. Pi's iteration order is `readdirSync`-dependent.
- **Resolved spawn args are now shown in the dedicated conversation viewer** ([#62](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/62)). Open `/subagent` → Running Agents → select an agent: a second header row displays the effective invocation — model override (when different from parent), `thinking: <level>`, `isolated`, `worktree`, `inherit context`, `background`, and `max turns: N`. Tags appear when the resolved value is notable (e.g. `isolated: true`), not just when the caller explicitly set it; `max turns` is the one exception and shows only when explicitly configured. Lets you verify the parent agent honored your spawn instructions without scrolling back through the chat. Snapshot stored on the new `AgentRecord.invocation` field. The same tag set is also surfaced on the `Agent` tool-call result render (which previously showed a narrower subset).
- **`Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` scroll a full page in the conversation viewer** — same behavior as `PgUp` / `PgDn`. Note: some terminal emulators intercept Shift+arrows for text selection or tab switching, in which case `PgUp`/`PgDn` remain available.

### Changed
- **`.txt` and extensionless flat skill files are no longer loaded.** Pi only supports `.md`; we now match. **Migration:** rename any `<name>.txt` / `<name>` skill files to `<name>.md`.
- **Conversation viewer no longer fills the full screen.** The overlay is now capped at 70% of terminal height (90% width unchanged), and the viewer's internal viewport mirrors that cap so the footer/scroll indicator can't be clipped.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-07

> **Heads-up — behavior change:**
> - `isolation: "worktree"` now fails loud (returns an error) instead of silently falling back to the main tree. Affects users running pi in a non-git directory or a fresh repo with no commits.

### Changed
- **`isolation: "worktree"` now fails loud instead of silently falling back.** Previously when `createWorktree` returned undefined (not a git repo, no commits yet, or `git worktree add` failed), the agent ran in the main `cwd` with a `[WARNING: ...]` block prepended to its prompt — visible only to the LLM, never surfaced to the caller. Now the failure throws a structured error that propagates back to the `Agent` tool response; no agent record is created. Failed scheduled fires are recorded as `lastStatus: "error"` with the reason in the `subagents:scheduled` error event. Queued background spawns whose worktree creation fails when they dequeue are marked terminal-error and don't block the rest of the queue.

### Fixed

- **Headless `pi --print` runs no longer hang or crash after background
subagents complete.** Cleanup timers no longer keep the process alive, and
stale completion notifications are treated as best-effort shutdown side
effects.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-04

> **Heads-up — behavior changes:**
> - `subagents:completed`/`failed` event `tokens.total` now excludes `cacheRead` (previously double-counted across turns) — see Fixed [#38].
> - Cron `?` is now a wildcard (same as `*`), not "current time value" — affects Quartz-style expressions only.

### Changed
- **`@mariozechner/pi-{ai,coding-agent,tui}` moved to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.70.5`).** Avoids duplicate framework instances when the host loads this extension.
- **`@sinclair/typebox` pinned from `latest` to `^0.34.49`** so installs are reproducible.
- **`croner` bumped 8 → 10.** Heads-up: in cron strings, `?` now means wildcard (same as `*`) instead of "current time value" — affects Quartz-style expressions only.

### Added
- **Master switch for scheduling** — new `schedulingEnabled` setting (default `true`) under `/agents → Settings → Scheduling`. When set to `false`: the `schedule` parameter and its guideline are stripped from the `Agent` tool spec at registration (zero LLM-context cost), the scheduler does not bind to the session, the `/agents → Scheduled jobs` menu entry is hidden, and any in-flight scheduler is stopped immediately. The schema-level removal applies on next pi session; the runtime kill (menu, fire path) takes effect immediately. Persisted at `<cwd>/.pi/subagents.json`.
- **Schedule subagent spawns** — the `Agent` tool now accepts an optional `schedule` parameter. When set, the spawn registers a job that fires later instead of running immediately. Three formats: 6-field cron (`"0 0 9 * * 1"` — 9am every Monday), interval (`"5m"`, `"1h"`), or one-shot (`"+10m"` or ISO timestamp). Returns the job ID. Schedules are session-scoped — they reset on `/new`, restore on `/resume` (mirrors the persistence model of pi-chonky-tasks). Storage at `<cwd>/.pi/subagent-schedules/<sessionId>.json`, with PID-based file locking + atomic temp+rename for concurrent-instance safety. **Result delivery is identical to today's background-spawn completions**: when the scheduled agent finishes, the existing `subagent-notification` followUp path emits the result to the conversation — no new delivery code, no new message types. **Concurrency**: scheduled fires bypass `maxConcurrent` so a 5-minute interval can't be deferred behind 4 long-running manual agents. **Management**: `/agents` → "Scheduled jobs" lists active jobs and lets you cancel any one of them. Creation is via the `Agent` tool only — no parallel manual-create wizard in this iteration. **Events**: `subagents:scheduled` ({ type: "added" | "removed" | "updated" | "fired" | "error", … }) and `subagents:scheduler_ready` for cross-extension consumers. **Restrictions**: `schedule` is incompatible with `inherit_context` (no parent at fire time) and `resume` (schedules create fresh agents); forces `run_in_background: true`. Scheduler engine mirrors `pi-cron-schedule` (`croner` for cron, `setInterval`/`setTimeout` for interval/once); past one-shot timestamps and invalid cron expressions are caught at create time.
- **Context-window utilization indicator in the subagent overlay** — token count is now followed by a colored `(NN%)` showing how full the subagent's context is right now (`estimateContextTokens(messages) / model.contextWindow * 100`, sourced from upstream `contextUsage.percent`). Threshold colors: <70% dim, 70–85% warning, ≥85% error. Gracefully omitted when the model has no `contextWindow` declared, or right after compaction before the next assistant turn (`tokens` is `null` in that window). The same annotation slot also surfaces a compaction count `↻N` when the agent has compacted at least once — e.g. `12.3k token (84% · ↻3)` (percent + compactions joined with `·`), `12.3k token (↻1)` (compactions only, immediately post-compaction while percent is still null). The compaction glyph stays dim regardless; the percent's threshold color carries the urgency signal. Two live overlays get the annotations (running stats line; inspect-overlay header); post-completion notifications and result/event payloads only get the count (the indicator is no longer actionable once the agent is done).
- **Token usage and context% exposed to the parent agent** at every interaction surface — `get_subagent_result` adds `Context: NN%` to its stats line; `steer_subagent` returns a `Current state: 12.3k token · 5 tool uses · context 72% full` line so the steering agent knows whether it has room before sending more context; `task-notification` XML adds `<context_percent>NN</context_percent>` (omitted when null). All plain-text, no ANSI codes — designed for LLM consumption, not human display.
- **New `subagents:compacted` lifecycle event** fires when a subagent's session successfully compacts. Payload: `{ id, type, description, reason: "manual" | "threshold" | "overflow", tokensBefore, compactionCount }` — `tokensBefore` is upstream's pre-compaction context size estimate; `compactionCount` is the running total for this agent (also persisted on `AgentRecord.compactionCount` and surfaced in `get_subagent_result` / `steer_subagent` / `task-notification` when > 0). Aborted compactions don't fire. Routed through a new manager-level `onCompact` constructor callback, matching the existing `onStart` / `onComplete` pattern.

### Fixed
- **Subagent token count was inflated 5–15× and reset mid-run** ([#38](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/38)). Two distinct bugs in the same field. (1) Upstream `getSessionStats().tokens.total` sums per-turn `cacheRead` across every assistant message — but each turn's `cacheRead` is the *cumulative* cached prefix re-read on that one API call, so summing N turns counts the prefix N times (quadratic inflation, very visible on long sessions). (2) Even with that fixed, anything derived from `session.state.messages` resets at compaction because upstream replaces the array via `this.agent.state.messages = sessionContext.messages`. Fix replaces all six display readers with a lifetime accumulator (`AgentRecord.lifetimeUsage` and `AgentActivity.lifetimeUsage` — `{ input, output, cacheWrite }`) fed by a new `onAssistantUsage` callback dispatched from `message_end` events in both `runAgent` and `resumeAgent`. The accumulator is independent of `state.messages` mutation, so it survives compaction; total = input + output + cacheWrite by construction (cacheRead deliberately excluded — same prefix-double-counting reason). The `subagents:completed`/`failed` event payload's `tokens` field is now also lifetime-accumulated for `input`, `output`, and `total` together (was: `total` lifetime, `input`/`output` session-derived → inconsistent after compaction).
- **ESC during a foreground `Agent` call now actually stops the subagent** ([#44](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/44) — thanks [@Zeng-Zer](https://github.com/Zeng-Zer)). Pi's interrupt path is `esc → agent.abort()` on the parent → `AbortSignal` delivered to every tool's `execute(toolCallId, params, signal, …)`, but the `Agent` tool dropped that signal on the floor: subagents ran on their own independent `AbortController` inside `AgentManager`, so the parent abort was invisible and the subagent kept running until natural completion or `max_turns`. Fix threads `signal` through `Agent.execute` → `manager.spawnAndWait()` → `SpawnOptions.signal`, and `AgentManager.startAgent()` now attaches an `{ once: true }` `"abort"` listener that calls `this.abort(id)` (which sets `status: "stopped"` and aborts the child controller). The listener is detached in both `.then` and `.catch` to avoid leaking on natural settle. **Scope:** foreground only — background agents intentionally outlive the parent tool call, so their spawn deliberately does not forward `signal`. Resume path (`AgentManager.resume()`) has the same blind spot and is tracked as a follow-up.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`run_in_background: true` (and `inherit_context`, `isolated`) silently ignored on default agents** ([#37](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/37) — thanks [@kylesnowschwartz](https://github.com/kylesnowschwartz) for the diagnosis). The three built-in defaults (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`) baked `runInBackground: false`, `inheritContext: false`, and `isolated: false` into their configs. `resolveAgentInvocationConfig` uses `agentConfig?.field ?? params.field ?? false`, and `??` only falls through on `null`/`undefined` — so an explicit `false` from the agent config silently won over the caller's `true`. Calling `Agent({ subagent_type: "general-purpose", run_in_background: true })` returned the result inline instead of backgrounding, blocking the parent UI for the agent's full runtime. Fix drops the three lines from each default (and from the unreachable defensive fallback in `agent-runner.ts`) — the type already declared each as `field?: boolean` with JSDoc *"undefined = caller decides"*, so the runtime now matches the documented contract. **Behavior:** custom agents that explicitly set these fields in frontmatter still lock as before (the v0.5.1 "frontmatter is authoritative" guarantee is preserved); the fix only stops *defaults* from spuriously claiming an opinion on callsite-strategy fields they don't actually have. The unreachable fallback now spreads `DEFAULT_AGENTS.get("general-purpose")` instead of duplicating the config inline, so future drift is impossible.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`Agent` tool fails on Windows with `ENOENT` creating output directory** ([#27](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/27) — thanks [@sixnathan](https://github.com/sixnathan) for the diagnosis). The cwd-encoding regex in `output-file.ts` only handled POSIX `/` separators, so on Windows `cwd = "C:\\Users\\foo\\project"` survived unchanged and `path.join(tmpRoot, encoded, …)` produced an invalid nested-absolute path. Now extracts a small `encodeCwd()` helper that handles both `/` and `\\` separators, strips the Windows drive-letter prefix, and preserves UNC server/share segments. The `chmodSync(root, 0o700)` call is also wrapped in a try/catch that swallows errors only on Windows (where chmod is a no-op and can throw on some filesystems); on Unix the error still propagates so umask-defeating `0o700` enforcement is preserved.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Persistent `/agents` → Settings** ([#24](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/24)) — the four runtime tuning values (`maxConcurrent`, `defaultMaxTurns`, `graceTurns`, `defaultJoinMode`) now survive pi restarts via a two-file dual-scope model mirroring pi's own `SettingsManager`. Global `~/.pi/agent/subagents.json` provides machine-wide defaults (edit by hand; the menu never writes here); project `<cwd>/.pi/subagents.json` holds per-project overrides (written by `/agents` → Settings). Load merges both with project winning on conflicts. Invalid fields are silently dropped per field; malformed JSON emits a warning to stderr and falls back to defaults so startup always proceeds; write failures downgrade the settings toast to a warning with `(session only; failed to persist)` so changes aren't silently reverted on next restart.
- **New lifecycle events** — `subagents:settings_loaded` (emitted once at extension init with the merged settings) and `subagents:settings_changed` (emitted on each `/agents` → Settings mutation with the new snapshot and a `persisted: boolean` flag so listeners can react to write failures).

### Fixed
- **`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` no longer leak into sub-agent prompts** ([#26](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/26) — thanks [@mikeyobrien](https://github.com/mikeyobrien) for the diagnosis). Upstream `buildSystemPrompt()` re-appends `contextFiles` and `appendSystemPrompt` *after* our `systemPromptOverride` runs, which silently defeated `prompt_mode: replace` and `isolated: true` — parent project context (e.g. autoresearch-mode blocks) was bleeding into fresh `Explore` / custom sub-agents regardless of frontmatter. Fix uses upstream's `noContextFiles: true` flag (skips the load entirely, introduced in pi 0.68) plus `appendSystemPromptOverride: () => []` (no flag equivalent for append sources). **Behavior change:** subagents no longer implicitly inherit parent `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. To get parent project context into a subagent, use `prompt_mode: append` (parent's already-built system prompt flows in via `systemPromptOverride`), or `inherit_context: true` (parent conversation), or inline the content into the agent's own frontmatter.
- **Custom agent discovery respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`** ([#35](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/35), closes [#23](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/23) — thanks [@Amolith](https://github.com/Amolith) for the diagnosis). Two remaining hardcoded `~/.pi/agent/agents/` paths in `custom-agents.ts` and `index.ts` bypassed the env var, so users who relocated their agent directory (e.g. via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) still had global agents loaded from the default location and help text referencing the wrong path. Both now use upstream `getAgentDir()`, consistent with `agent-runner.ts` and `settings.ts`; tilde expansion is handled by upstream.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-24

> **⚠️ Breaking: drops support for `pi` < 0.68.** The upstream `pi-coding-agent` package shipped breaking API changes in v0.68 (and further ones in v0.70). This release migrates to `^0.70.2` and is **not** backward-compatible with hosts on `pi` 0.62–0.67. Users on those versions must upgrade their `pi` installation (`npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@latest`) before updating this extension.

### Changed
- **Bumped peer `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to `^0.70.2`** ([#28](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/28)) — crosses the v0.68 breaking-change line upstream. Specifically: tools are now passed as `string[]` (was `Tool[]`); `cwd`/`agentDir` are mandatory on `SettingsManager.create()` and `DefaultResourceLoader`; `session_switch` event renamed to `session_before_switch`; `ToolDefinition.params` widens to `unknown` under contextual typing, requiring `defineTool(...)`.
- **Tool registrations wrapped with `defineTool(...)`** — preserves `TParams` inference so `execute` handlers get properly-typed `params` instead of `unknown`. Applies to the `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` tools.

### Removed
- **Cwd-bound tool factory registry** — the internal `TOOL_FACTORIES` closure table and `create{Bash,Edit,Read,Write,Grep,Find,Ls}Tool` imports are gone. Exported helpers renamed: `getToolsForType(type, cwd)` → `getToolNamesForType(type)`, `getMemoryTools(cwd, set)` → `getMemoryToolNames(set)`, `getReadOnlyMemoryTools(cwd, set)` → `getReadOnlyMemoryToolNames(set)` — all returning `string[]` instead of `Tool[]`. The host binds cwd when resolving tool names, so the extension no longer instantiates tools directly.

### Fixed
- **Subagent `SettingsManager` read wrong project settings in worktree mode** ([#30](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/30)) — `SettingsManager.create()` was called without arguments, defaulting `cwd` to `process.cwd()`. When the subagent's effective cwd differed (worktree isolation or explicit `cwd` override), its settings manager read `.pi/settings.json` from the parent's cwd rather than its own, diverging from the loader and session manager. Now passes `effectiveCwd` and `agentDir` explicitly, keeping all three managers consistent.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Extension `session_start` handlers now fire in subagent sessions** ([#20](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/20)) — `bindExtensions()` was never called on subagent sessions, so extensions that initialize state in `session_start` (e.g. loading credentials, setting up connections) silently failed at runtime. Tools appeared registered but were non-functional. Now calls `session.bindExtensions()` after tool filtering and before prompting, matching the lifecycle used by pi's interactive, print, and RPC modes. Also triggers `extendResourcesFromExtensions("startup")` so extension-provided skills and prompts are discovered.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Agent config is authoritative** — frontmatter values for `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `isolated`, and `isolation` now take precedence over `Agent` tool-call parameters. Tool-call params only fill fields the agent config leaves unspecified.
- **`join_mode` is now a global setting only** — removed the per-call `join_mode` parameter from the `Agent` tool. Join behavior is configured via `/agents` → Settings → Join mode.
- **`max_turns: 0` means unlimited** — agent files can now explicitly set `max_turns: 0` to lock unlimited turns. Previously `0` was silently clamped to `1`.

### Fixed
- **Final subagent text preserved from non-streaming providers** — agents using providers that return the final message without streaming `text_delta` events no longer return empty results. Falls back to extracting text from the completed session history.
- **`effectiveMaxTurns` passed to spawn calls** — previously `params.max_turns` was passed raw to both foreground and background spawn, bypassing the agent config entirely.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **RPC stop handler** — new `subagents:rpc:stop` event bus RPC allows other extensions to stop running subagents by agent ID. Returns structured error ("Agent not found") on failure.
- **`abort` in `SpawnCapable` interface** — cross-extension RPC consumers can now stop agents, not just spawn them.
- **Live turn counter** — all agents now show a live turn count in the widget, inline result, and completion notification. With a turn limit: `⟳5≤30` (5 of 30 turns). Without: `⟳5`. Updates in real time as turns progress via `onTurnEnd` callback.
- **Biome linting** — added [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for correctness linting (unused imports, suspicious patterns). Style rules disabled. Run `npm run lint` to check, `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix.
- **CI workflow** — GitHub Actions runs lint, typecheck, and tests on push to master and PRs.
- **Auto-trigger parent turn on background completion** — background agent completion notifications now use `triggerTurn: true`, automatically prompting the parent agent to process results instead of waiting for user input.

### Changed
- **Standardized RPC envelope** — cross-extension RPC handlers (`ping`, `spawn`, `stop`) now use a `handleRpc` wrapper that emits structured envelopes (`{ success: true, data }` / `{ success: false, error }`), matching pi-mono's `RpcResponse` convention.
- **Protocol versioning via ping** — ping reply now includes `{ version: PROTOCOL_VERSION }` (currently v2). Callers can detect version mismatches and warn users to update.
- **Default max turns is now unlimited** — subagents no longer have a 50-turn default cap. The default is unlimited (no turn limit), matching Claude Code's main loop behavior. Users can still set explicit limits per-agent via `max_turns` frontmatter or the Agent tool parameter, or globally via `/agents` → Settings (`0` = unlimited).
- **Stale dist in published package** — added `prepublishOnly` hook to build fresh `dist/` on every `npm publish`.

### Fixed
- **Tool name display** — `getAgentConversation` now reads `ToolCall.name` (the correct property) instead of `toolName`, resolving `[Tool: unknown]` in conversation viewer and verbose output.
- **Env test CI failure** — `detectEnv` test assumed a branch name exists, but CI checks out detached HEAD. Split into separate tests for repo detection and branch detection with a controlled temp repo.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Conversation viewer crash in narrow terminals** ([#7](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/7)) — `buildContentLines()` in the live conversation viewer could return lines wider than the terminal when `wrapTextWithAnsi()` misjudged visible width on ANSI-heavy input (e.g. tool output with embedded escape codes, long URLs, wide tables). All content lines are now clamped with `truncateToWidth()` before returning. Same class of bug as the widget fix in v0.2.7, different component.

### Added
- **Conversation viewer width-safety tests** — 17 tests covering `render()` and `buildContentLines()` across varied content (plain text, ANSI codes, unicode, tables, long URLs, narrow terminals). Includes mock-based regression tests that simulate upstream `wrapTextWithAnsi` returning overwidth lines, ensuring the safety net catches them.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Cross-extension RPC** — other pi extensions can spawn subagents via `pi.events` event bus (`subagents:rpc:ping`, `subagents:rpc:spawn`). Emits `subagents:ready` on load.
- **Session persistence for agent records** — completed agent records are persisted via `pi.appendEntry("subagents:record", ...)` for cross-extension history reconstruction.

### Fixed
- **Background agent notification race condition** — `pi.sendMessage()` is fire-and-forget, so completion notifications sent eagerly from `onComplete` could not be retracted when `get_subagent_result` was called in the same turn. Notifications are now held behind a 200ms cancellable timer; `get_subagent_result` cancels the pending timer before it fires, eliminating duplicate notifications. Group notifications also re-check `resultConsumed` at send time so consumed agents are filtered out.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Custom notification renderer** — background agent completion notifications now render as styled, themed boxes instead of raw XML. Uses `pi.registerMessageRenderer()` with the `"subagent-notification"` custom message type. The LLM continues to receive `<task-notification>` XML via `content`; only the user-facing display changes.
- **Group notification rendering** — group completions render each agent as its own styled block (icon, description, stats, result preview) instead of showing only the first agent.
- **Output file streaming for background agents** — background agents now get the same output file transcript as foreground agents, with `onSessionCreated` wiring and proper cleanup on completion/error.
- `NotificationDetails` type in `types.ts` — structured details for the notification renderer, with optional `others` array for group notifications.
- `buildNotificationDetails()` helper — extracts renderer-facing details from an `AgentRecord`.

### Changed
- **Notification delivery** — `sendIndividualNudge` and group notification now use `pi.sendMessage()` (custom message) instead of `pi.sendUserMessage()` (plain text), enabling renderer-controlled display.
- **Steered status rendering** — steered agents show "completed (steered)" in the notification box instead of plain "completed".

### Fixed
- **Output file cleanup on completion** — `agent-manager.ts` now calls `record.outputCleanup()` in both the success and error paths of agent completion, ensuring the streaming subscription is flushed and released.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown aborts agents instead of blocking** — `session_shutdown` now calls `abortAll()` instead of `waitForAll()`, so the process exits immediately instead of hanging until all background agents complete. Agent results are undeliverable after shutdown anyway.

### Added
- `abortAll()` method on `AgentManager` — stops all queued and running agents at once, returning the count of affected agents.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Widget render-once pattern** — the widget callback is now registered once via `setWidget()` and subsequent updates use `requestRender()` instead of re-registering the entire widget on every `update()` call. Eliminates layout thrashing from repeated widget teardown/setup cycles.
- **Status bar dedup** — `setStatus()` is now only called when the status text actually changes, avoiding redundant TUI updates.
- **UICtx change detection** — `setUICtx()` detects context changes and forces widget re-registration, correctly handling session switches.

### Refactored
- Extracted `renderWidget()` private method — moves all widget content rendering out of the `update()` closure into a standalone method that reads live state on each call.
- `update()` is now a lightweight coordinator: counts agents, manages registration lifecycle, and triggers re-renders.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Race condition in `get_subagent_result` with `wait: true`** — `resultConsumed` is now set before `await record.promise`, preventing a redundant follow-up notification. Previously the `onComplete` callback (attached at spawn time via `.then()`) always fired before the await resumed, seeing `resultConsumed` as false.
- **Stale agent records across sessions** — new `clearCompleted()` method removes all completed/stopped/errored agent records on `session_start` and `session_switch` events, so tasks from a prior session don't persist into a new one.
- **`steer_subagent` race on freshly launched agents** — steering an agent before its session initialized silently dropped the message. Now steers are queued on the record and flushed once `onSessionCreated` fires.

### Changed
- Extracted `removeRecord()` private helper in `AgentManager` — deduplicates dispose+delete logic between `cleanup()` and `clearCompleted()`.

### Added
- 8 new tests covering `resultConsumed` race condition and `clearCompleted` behavior (185 total).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Persistent agent memory** — new `memory` frontmatter field with three scopes: `"user"` (global `~/.pi/`), `"project"` (per-project `.pi/`), `"local"` (gitignored `.pi/`). Agents with write/edit tools get full read-write memory; read-only agents get a read-only fallback that injects existing MEMORY.md content without granting write access or creating directories.
- **Git worktree isolation** — new `isolation: "worktree"` frontmatter field and Agent tool parameter. Creates a temporary `git worktree` so agents work on an isolated copy of the repo. On completion, changes are auto-committed to a `pi-agent-<id>` branch; clean worktrees are removed. Includes crash recovery via `pruneWorktrees()`.
- **Skill preloading** — `skills` frontmatter now accepts a comma-separated list of skill names (e.g. `skills: planning, review`). Reads from `.pi/skills/` (project) then `~/.pi/skills/` (global), tries `.md`/`.txt`/bare extensions. Content injected into the system prompt as `# Preloaded Skill: {name}`.
- **Tool denylist** — new `disallowed_tools` frontmatter field (e.g. `disallowed_tools: bash, write`). Blocks specified tools even if `builtinToolNames` or extensions would provide them. Enforced for both extension-enabled and extension-disabled agents.
- **Prompt extras system** — new `PromptExtras` interface in `prompts.ts`; `buildAgentPrompt()` accepts optional memory and skill blocks appended in both `replace` and `append` modes.
- `getMemoryTools()`, `getReadOnlyMemoryTools()` in `agent-types.ts`.
- `buildMemoryBlock()`, `buildReadOnlyMemoryBlock()`, `isSymlink()`, `safeReadFile()` in `memory.ts`.
- `preloadSkills()` in `skill-loader.ts`.
- `createWorktree()`, `cleanupWorktree()`, `pruneWorktrees()` in `worktree.ts`.
- `MemoryScope`, `IsolationMode` types; `memory`, `isolation`, `disallowedTools` fields on `AgentConfig`; `worktree`, `worktreeResult` fields on `AgentRecord`.
- 177 total tests across 8 test files (41 new tests).

### Fixed
- **Read-only agents no longer escalated to read-write** — enabling `memory` on a read-only agent (e.g. Explore) previously auto-added `write`/`edit` tools. Now the runner detects write capability and branches: read-write agents get full memory tools, read-only agents get read-only memory prompt with only the `read` tool added.
- **Denylist-aware memory detection** — write capability check now accounts for `disallowedTools`. An agent with `tools: write` + `disallowed_tools: write` correctly gets read-only memory instead of broken read-write instructions.
- **Worktree requires commits** — repos with no commits (empty HEAD) are now rejected early with a warning instead of failing silently at `git worktree add`.
- **Worktree failure warning** — when worktree creation fails, a warning is prepended to the agent's prompt instead of silently falling through to the main cwd.
- **No force-branch overwrite** — worktree cleanup appends a timestamp suffix on branch name conflict instead of using `git branch -f`.

### Security
- **Whitelist name validation** — agent/skill names must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$`, max 128 chars. Rejects path traversal, leading dots, spaces, and special characters.
- **Symlink protection** — `safeReadFile()` and `isSymlink()` reject symlinks in memory directories, MEMORY.md files, and skill files, preventing arbitrary file reads.
- **Symlink-safe directory creation** — `ensureMemoryDir()` throws on symlinked directories.

### Changed
- `agent-runner.ts`: tool/extension/skill resolution moved before memory detection; `ctx.cwd` → `effectiveCwd` throughout.
- `custom-agents.ts`: extracted `parseCsvField()` helper; added `csvListOptional()` and `parseMemory()`.
- `skill-loader.ts`: uses `safeReadFile()` from `memory.ts` instead of raw `readFileSync`.
- Agent tool schema updated with `isolation` parameter and help text for `memory`, `isolation`, `disallowed_tools`, and skill list.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Event bus** — agent lifecycle events emitted via `pi.events.emit()`, enabling other extensions to react to sub-agent activity:
  - `subagents:created` — background agent registered (includes `id`, `type`, `description`, `isBackground`)
  - `subagents:started` — agent transitions to running (includes queued→running)
  - `subagents:completed` — agent finished successfully (includes `durationMs`, `tokens`, `toolUses`, `result`)
  - `subagents:failed` — agent errored, stopped, or aborted (same payload as completed)
  - `subagents:steered` — steering message sent to a running agent
- `OnAgentStart` callback and `onStart` constructor parameter on `AgentManager`.
- **Cross-package manager** now also exposes `spawn()` and `getRecord()` via the `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` global.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown in headless mode** — the CLI now waits for all running and queued background agents to complete before exiting (`waitForAll` on `session_shutdown`). Previously, background agents could be silently killed mid-execution when the session ended. Only affects headless/non-interactive mode; interactive sessions already kept the process alive.

### Added
- `hasRunning()` / `waitForAll()` methods on `AgentManager`.
- **Cross-package manager access** — agent manager exposed via `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` on `globalThis` for other extensions to check status or await completion.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **XML-delimited prompt sections** — append-mode agents now wrap inherited content in `<inherited_system_prompt>`, `<sub_agent_context>`, and `<agent_instructions>` XML tags, giving the model explicit structure to distinguish inherited rules from sub-agent-specific instructions. Replace mode is unchanged.
- **Token count in agent results** — foreground agent results, background completion notifications, and `get_subagent_result` now include the token count alongside tool uses and duration (e.g. `Agent completed in 4.2s (12 tool uses, 33.8k token)`).
- **Widget overflow cap** — the running agents widget now caps at 12 lines. When exceeded, running agents are prioritized over finished ones and an overflow summary line shows hidden counts (e.g. `+3 more (1 running, 2 finished)`).

### Changed - **changing behavior**
- **General-purpose agent inherits parent prompt** — the default `general-purpose` agent now uses `promptMode: "append"` with an empty system prompt, making it a "parent twin" that inherits the full parent system prompt (including CLAUDE.md rules, project conventions, and safety guardrails). Previously it used a standalone prompt that duplicated a subset of the parent's rules. Explore and Plan are unchanged (standalone prompts). To customize: eject via `/agents` → select `general-purpose` → Eject, then edit the resulting `.md` file. Set `prompt_mode: replace` to go back to a standalone prompt, or keep `prompt_mode: append` and add extra instructions in the body.
- **Append-mode agents receive parent system prompt** — `buildAgentPrompt` now accepts the parent's system prompt and threads it into append-mode agents (env header + parent prompt + sub-agent context bridge + optional custom instructions). Replace-mode agents are unchanged.
- **Prompt pipeline simplified** — removed `systemPromptOverride`/`systemPromptAppend` from `SpawnOptions` and `RunOptions`. These were a separate code path where `index.ts` pre-resolved the prompt mode and passed raw strings into the runner, bypassing `buildAgentPrompt`. Now all prompt assembly flows through `buildAgentPrompt` using the agent's `promptMode` config — one code path, no special cases.

### Removed
- Deprecated backwards-compat aliases: `registerCustomAgents`, `getCustomAgentConfig`, `getCustomAgentNames` (use `registerAgents`, `getAgentConfig`, `getUserAgentNames`).
- `resolveCustomPrompt()` helper in index.ts — no longer needed now that prompt routing is config-driven.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Live conversation viewer** — selecting a running (or completed) agent in `/agents` → "Running agents" now opens a scrollable overlay showing the agent's full conversation in real time. Auto-scrolls to follow new content; scroll up to pause, End to resume. Press Esc to close.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Case-insensitive agent type lookup** — `"explore"`, `"EXPLORE"`, and `"Explore"` all resolve to the same agent. LLMs frequently lowercase type names; this prevents validation failures.
- **Unknown type fallback** — unrecognized agent types fall back to `general-purpose` with a note, instead of hard-rejecting. Matches Claude Code behavior.
- **Dynamic tool list for general-purpose** — `builtinToolNames` is now optional in `AgentConfig`. When omitted, the agent gets all tools from `TOOL_FACTORIES` at lookup time, so new tools added upstream are automatically available.
- **Agent source indicators in `/agents` menu** — `•` (project), `◦` (global), `✕` (disabled) with legend. Defaults are unmarked.
- **Disabled agents visible in UI** — disabled agents now show in the "Agent types" list (marked `✕`) with an Enable action, instead of being invisible.
- **Enable action** — re-enable a disabled agent from the `/agents` menu. Stub files are auto-cleaned.
- **Disable action for all agent types** — custom and ejected default agents can now be disabled from the UI, not just built-in defaults.
- `resolveType()` export — case-insensitive type name resolution for external use.
- `getAllTypes()` export — returns all agent names including disabled (for UI listing).
- `source` field on `AgentConfig` — tracks where an agent was loaded from (`"default"`, `"project"`, `"global"`).

### Fixed
- **Model resolver checks auth for exact matches** — `resolveModel("anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")` now fails gracefully when no Anthropic API key is configured, instead of returning a model that errors at the API call. Explore silently falls back to the parent model on non-Anthropic setups.

### Changed
- **Unified agent registry** — built-in and custom agents now use the same `AgentConfig` type and a single registry. No more separate code paths for built-in vs custom agents.
- **Default agents are overridable** — creating a `.md` file with the same name as a default agent (e.g. `.pi/agents/Explore.md`) overrides it.
- **`/agents` menu** — "Agent types" list shows defaults and custom agents together with source indicators. Default agents get Eject/Disable actions; overridden defaults get Reset to default.
- **Eject action** — export a default agent's embedded config as a `.md` file to project or personal location for customization.
- **Model labels** — provider-agnostic: strips `provider/` prefix and `-YYYYMMDD` date suffix (e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` → `claude-haiku-4-5`). Works for any provider.
- **New frontmatter fields** — `display_name` (UI display name) and `enabled` (default: true; set to false to disable).
- **Menu navigation** — Esc in agent detail returns to agent list (not main menu).

### Removed
- **`statusline-setup` and `claude-code-guide` agents** — removed as built-in types (never spawned programmatically). Users can recreate them as custom agents if needed.
- `BuiltinSubagentType` union type, `SUBAGENT_TYPES` array, `DISPLAY_NAMES` map, `SubagentTypeConfig` interface — replaced by unified `AgentConfig`.
- `buildSystemPrompt()` switch statement — replaced by config-driven `buildAgentPrompt()`.
- `HAIKU_MODEL_IDS` fallback array — Explore's haiku default is now just the `model` field in its config.
- `BUILTIN_MODEL_LABELS` — model labels now derived from config.
- `ALL_TOOLS` hardcoded constant — general-purpose now derives tools dynamically.

### Added
- `src/default-agents.ts` — embedded default configs for general-purpose, Explore, and Plan.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Widget crash in narrow terminals** — agent widget lines were not truncated to terminal width, causing `doRender` to throw when the tmux pane was narrower than the rendered content. All widget lines are now truncated using `truncateToWidth()` with the actual terminal column count.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Background task join strategies** — smart grouping of background agent completion notifications
  - `smart` (default): 2+ background agents spawned in the same turn are auto-grouped into a single consolidated notification instead of individual nudges
  - `async`: each agent notifies individually on completion (previous behavior)
  - `group`: force grouping even for solo agents
  - 30s timeout after first completion delivers partial results; 15s straggler re-batch window for remaining agents
- **`join_mode` parameter** on the `Agent` tool — override join strategy per agent (`"async"` or `"group"`)
- **Join mode setting** in `/agents` → Settings — configure the default join mode at runtime
- New `src/group-join.ts` — `GroupJoinManager` class for batched completion notifications

### Changed
- `AgentRecord` now includes optional `groupId`, `joinMode`, and `resultConsumed` fields
- Background agent completion routing refactored: individual nudge logic extracted to `sendIndividualNudge()`, group delivery via `GroupJoinManager`

### Fixed
- **Debounce window race** — agents that complete during the 100ms batch debounce window are now deferred and retroactively fed into the group once it's registered, preventing split notifications (one individual + one partial group) and zombie groups
- **Solo agent swallowed notification** — if only one agent was spawned (no group formed) but it completed during the debounce window, its deferred notification is now sent when the batch finalizes
- **Duplicate notifications after polling** — calling `get_subagent_result` on a completed agent now marks its result as consumed, suppressing the subsequent completion notification (both individual and group)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Interactive `/agents` menu** — single command replaces `/agent` and `/agents` with a full management wizard
  - Browse and manage running agents
  - Custom agents submenu — edit or delete existing agents
  - Create new custom agents via manual wizard or AI-generated (with comprehensive frontmatter documentation for the generator)
  - Settings: configure max concurrency, default max turns, and grace turns at runtime
  - Built-in agent types shown with model info (e.g. `Explore · haiku`)
  - Aligned formatting for agent lists
- **Configurable turn limits** — `defaultMaxTurns` and `graceTurns` are now runtime-adjustable via `/agents` → Settings
- Sub-menus return to main menu instead of exiting

### Removed
- `/agent <type> <prompt>` command (use `Agent` tool directly, or create custom agents via `/agents`)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Global custom agents** — agents in `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` are now discovered automatically and available across all projects
- Two-tier discovery hierarchy: project-level (`.pi/agents/`) overrides global (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Screenshot in README

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Renamed package to `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`
- Fuzzy model resolver now only matches models with auth configured (prevents selecting unconfigured providers)
- Custom agents hot-reload on each `Agent` tool call (no restart needed for new `.pi/agents/*.md` files)
- Updated pi dependencies to 0.56.1

### Refactored
- Extracted `createActivityTracker()` — eliminates duplicated tool activity wiring between foreground and background paths
- Extracted `safeFormatTokens()` — replaces 4 repeated try-catch blocks
- Extracted `buildDetails()` — consolidates AgentDetails construction
- Extracted `getStatusLabel()` / `getStatusNote()` — consolidates 3 duplicated status formatting chains
- Shared `extractText()` — consolidated duplicate from context.ts and agent-runner.ts
- Added `ERROR_STATUSES` constant in widget for consistent status checks
- `getDisplayName()` now delegates to `getConfig()` instead of separate lookups
- Removed unused `Tool` type export from agent-types

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Persistent above-editor widget** — tree view of all running/queued/finished agents with animated spinners and live stats
- **Concurrency queue** — configurable max concurrent background agents (default: 4), auto-drain
- **Queued agents** collapsed to single summary line in widget
- **Turn-based widget linger** — completed agents clear after 1 turn, errors/aborted linger for 2 extra turns
- **Colored status icons** — themed rendering via `setWidget` callback form (`✓` green, `✓` yellow, `✗` red, `■` dim)
- **Live response streaming** — `onTextDelta` shows truncated agent response text instead of static "thinking..."

### Changed
- Tool names match Claude Code: `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, `steer_subagent`
- Labels use "Agent" / "Agents" (not "Subagent")
- Widget heading: `●` when active, `○` when only lingering finished agents
- Extracted all UI code to `src/ui/agent-widget.ts`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Claude Code-style UI rendering** — `renderCall`/`renderResult`/`onUpdate` for live streaming progress
  - Live activity descriptions: "searching, reading 3 files…"
  - Token count display: "33.8k token"
  - Per-agent tool use counter
  - Expandable completed results (ctrl+o)
  - Distinct states: running, background, completed, error, aborted
- **Async environment detection** — replaced `execSync` with `pi.exec()` for non-blocking git/platform detection
- **Status bar integration** — running background agent count shown in pi's status bar
- **Fuzzy model selection** — `"haiku"`, `"sonnet"` resolve to best matching available model

### Changed
- Tool label changed from "Spawn Agent" to "Agent" (matches Claude Code style)
- `onToolUse` callback replaced with richer `onToolActivity` (includes tool name + start/end)
- `onSessionCreated` callback for accessing session stats (token counts)
- `env.ts` now requires `ExtensionAPI` parameter (async `pi.exec()` instead of `execSync`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-05

Initial release.

### Added
- **Autonomous sub-agents** — spawn specialized agents via tool call, each running in an isolated pi session
- **Built-in agent types** — general-purpose, Explore (defaults to haiku), Plan, statusline-setup, claude-code-guide
- **Custom user-defined agents** — define agents in `.pi/agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter + system prompt body

- **Graceful max_turns** — steer message at limit, 5 grace turns, then hard abort
- **Background execution** — `run_in_background` with completion notifications
- **`get_subagent_result` tool** — check status, wait for completion, verbose conversation output
- **`steer_subagent` tool** — inject steering messages into running agents mid-execution
- **Agent resume** — continue a previous agent's session with a new prompt
- **Context inheritance** — fork the parent conversation into the sub-agent
- **Model override** — per-agent model selection
- **Thinking level** — per-agent extended thinking control
- **`/agent` and `/agents` commands**
